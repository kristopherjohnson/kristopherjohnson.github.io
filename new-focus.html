</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've been thinking a lot about what I want <em>Undefined Value</em> to be. These are the reasons I have this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy writing and I like to practice.</li>
<li>I want to make contact with other people who care about the things I care about.</li>
<li>I want to be able to go back and review what I was thinking in the past.</li>
<li>For potential clients and employers, I want to have a collection of writings that demonstrate that I'm smart and that I take my work very seriously.</li>
<li>I want to exercise my rudimentary website design and administration skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't expect to become a top blogger or generate ad revenue or become an influential thought leader. However, I do want people to read what I write, so I want to attract readers and keep the quality high.</p>
<p>To that end, I have decided to narrow the focus of this blog. Up to now, I think the audience of <em>Undefined Value</em> has consisted of these segments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software developers</li>
<li>People who are not software developers, but who are interested in software and information technology</li>
<li>Private pilots</li>
<li>Friends and family</li>
</ol>
<p>Going forward, I'm going to concentrate on the first two groups. I haven't flown for a couple of years, so I don't have much to say to pilots anymore. The friends and family can be served via <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=552697319&amp;ref=name">Facebook</a> or my <a href="http://kristopherjohnson.net/">personal website</a>.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean I won't occasionally post a picture of my dogs or re-tell a good fart joke I overheard. It just means that I'm going to focus on things that are of interest to "technology people."</p>
<p>I want to be both a teacher and a learner, so I'll be posting articles that share what I've learned but which also invite commentary.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and let me know what you want me to write about.</p>
