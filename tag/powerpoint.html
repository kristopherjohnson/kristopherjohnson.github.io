</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The instructor in one of my MBA-prerequisite classes distributed a set of PowerPoint presentations as course notes. I want to review these on my iPad, so I needed to convert them to Keynote.</p>
<p>This is pretty easy to do manually on a Mac: Just right-click the PPT file, select <strong>Open With... -&gt; Keynote</strong> from the menu (which reads the PowerPoint file into Keynote), then <strong>File -&gt; Save As...</strong> to store it where you want it. However, I am a programmer, so I would rather spend a few hours figuring out how to write a program to do a repetitive task than simply spend the five minutes needed to do it by hand.</p>
<p>At first I tried using Apple's Automator utility, which is supposed to make stuff like this easy, but I couldn't figure it out. So, I took the plunge into AppleScript.</p>
<p>As with every foray I make into AppleScriptLand, I was frustrated, annoyed, saddened, and exhausted by the experience. But I did succeed (if two hours spent futzing with AppleScript can possibly be called a <em>success</em>).</p>
<p>So, if you have need for a utility for converting a bunch of PowerPoint files to Keynote, open up the AppleScript Editor and copy and paste this script into the window:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>on open droppedFiles
    set theDestinationFolder to (choose folder with prompt &quot;Choose destination folder&quot;) as Unicode text
    repeat with theFile in droppedFiles
        tell application &quot;Keynote&quot;
            open theFile
            set theSlideshow to slideshow 1
            set theDestinationPath to theDestinationFolder &amp; (name of theSlideshow)
            save theSlideshow in theDestinationPath
            close theSlideshow
        end tell
    end repeat
end open
</pre></div>


<p>Click the <strong>Compile</strong> button, and assuming you see no errors, choose <strong>File -&gt; Save</strong>, set the File Format to <strong>Application</strong>, and save it to the desired place with the desired name.</p>
<p>Then, to convert files, just select them in the Finder and drag them onto the application icon. You will be prompted for a destination folder, then the script will do its thing.</p>
<p>The script looks pretty simple and straightforward, right? Well, AppleScript is a language that is easy to read, but very, very difficult to write. Every programming language that tries to "look like plain English" is a nightmare to use, because like English, the rules are illogical, arbitrary, and self-contradictory. Every application, like Keynote, has its own commands and object types, and the documentation is poor, so you end up doing a lot of experimentation and hair-pulling. The hardest part of this particular script was figuring out that I needed to add the <code>as Unicode text</code> conversion in order to produce a valid file path.</p>
