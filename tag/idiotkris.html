My wife has a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a>.  One of the things that makes it so light is that it doesn't have an internal SuperDrive (writable DVD/CD).  Apple sells a special external SuperDrive designed to specifically work with the MacBook Air.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, we couldn't get the SuperDrive to work.  Any disc we inserted would be ejected, without being recognized by the computer.  After a few days of struggling with this, we decided we'd take it back to the local Apple Store.
</p>

<p>
We live far away from civilization, and a trip to the Apple Store requires D-Day-like preparation.  So, the SuperDrive sat on the desk for a while.  Then my wife figured out the problem:
</p>

<p>
It was upside-down.
</p>

<p>
Yep, we were trying to use the SuperDrive when it was <em>upside-down</em>.
</p>

<p>
You see, Apple products aren't designed like other computer manufacturer's products.  Most products have a shiny logo on the top of the product, and the bottom looks like a piece of Soviet military hardware.  The MacBook Air SuperDrive has a shiny silver side, and a shiny side with an Apple logo.
</p>

<p>
It never occurred to us that the logo-side would be the bottom.  She turned it logo-side-down, and now it works fine.
</p>

<p>
We feel really smart for figuring that one out.  At least we didn't have to be told by a Genius at the Apple Store.

We got an Xbox 360 this weekend.  I went to the store to buy Guitar Hero III for it.
</p>

<p>
I came home with Guitar Hero III <em>for the Playstation 3!</em>  We don't have a Playstation 3.
</p>

<p>
It's true: eventually, we all turn into our parents.

As indicated in previous posts, I got married on April 5.  Although it was obviously one of the most important events in my life, I haven't written much about it, due to lack of free time.  So, here's all the stuff I should have written during the past few weeks â€¦</p>
