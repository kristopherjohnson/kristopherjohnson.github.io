Today is the anniversary of the first communication between my wife and myself.  How did we celebrate?  By playing online games on our <i>two</i> Xbox 360 consoles; one in the family room, and one in the bedroom, shouting taunts at one another.
</p>

<p>
Some may think it's a little sad that we did this, but think about it this way:  what is the likelihood that each of us would have found another person who would have thought this was a great way to spend an evening?
</p>

<p>
By the way, this is the first time we've played games like this.  And my wife probably won't immediately recognize the Star Trek allusion in this post's title.  She's not <i>that</i> geeky, which is a very good thing.

As indicated in previous posts, I got married on April 5.  Although it was obviously one of the most important events in my life, I haven't written much about it, due to lack of free time.  So, here's all the stuff I should have written during the past few weeks …</p>

I'm getting married.  You may congratulate me.

I asked The Question, and she said yes.  I know you're supposed to buy an engagement ring first, and present it as part of the proposal, but I wasn't really prepared when the conversation happened.  So, the following day, we went out to …</p>

One thing that makes me laugh about eHarmony.com and Match.com is the terrible pictures that women post of themselves.  Most of the pictures are of women at company Christmas parties, wedding receptions, or at other kinds of celebrations, which means that the pictures usually have the following features …</p>
