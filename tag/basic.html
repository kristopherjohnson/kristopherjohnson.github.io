</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This week, we learned that <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/farewell-dr-dobbs/240169421"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em> is shutting down after 38 years</a>. Admittedly, I haven't paid much attention to <em>Dr. Dobb's</em> for the past few years, but back when I was a kid who wanted to be a programmer, I anxiously awaited each monthly issue so that I could read every single article multiple times. We didn't have the Internet to give us whatever training we needed whenever we wanted, so magazines like <em>Dr. Dobb's</em> were precious.</p>
<p>While reminiscing about <em>Dr. Dobb's</em> with other grieving Twitter users, somebody brought up the fact that the first issue was titled <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/sourcecode/dr-dobbs-journal-30/30000144">"Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte"</a>  (which I think is the coolest magazine title I've ever heard). It started as a xerographed newsletter to tell people about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC"><em>Tiny BASIC</em></a>, a simplified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC programming language</a> interpreter that could run in 2 or 3 kilobytes of memory. That was an important feature back when personal computers had only 4 kilobytes of memory.</p>
<p>Having just completed an implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/suwaneeforth">Forth programming language interpreter</a> in Apple's new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> programming language, I got the idea of implementing a Tiny BASIC interpreter in Swift. It didn't make any sense. I didn't want to write any programs in Tiny BASIC. I didn't think anybody else would want to write any programs in Tiny BASIC. There are more important things I could be doing with my free time.</p>
<p>But, apparently, reimplementing 50-year-old programming languages in Swift is my thing now</p>
<p>I did it. I call it "Finch", and if you want it, you can find it here:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/FinchBasic</li>
</ul>
<p>Useless as it may be, it was an interesting exercise. Most of the Tiny BASIC implementations you find are focused on the original goal: getting a full implementation to fit in a few kilobytes. That isn't an important goal anymore, but I liked the idea of implementing a very-simple programming language. I focused on these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Swift's high-level abstraction features, rather than writing code that looks like C or assembly language.</li>
<li>Make it easy for new Swift programmers to understand, so it could be useful as a beginner's example or in a tutorial.</li>
<li>Make it easy for people to hack on to add new features.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I did alright. It's about a thousand lines of code (not counting blank lines and comments), which is smaller than a <a href="http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/TinyBasic/TinyBasic.c">C-based Tiny BASIC implementation</a> I found, and I don't think I did anything too complicated. I will have to wait and see if anyone else wants to hack on it.</p>
<p>BASIC was the first programming language I learned. I expressed an interest in programming after attending an IBM open house, and my father brought home a BASIC programming manual. I studied it intently, but there weren't any computers around, so it was a while before I could try out what I had learned. But eventually the Radio Shack at the local mall started selling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80</a>, and I could walk into that store and write my very first program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>10 PRINT &quot;TRS-80 SUCKS! &quot;;
20 GOTO 10
RUN
</pre></div>


<p>With great power comes great responsibility.</p>                </article>
