</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/Markingbird">Markingbird</a> is a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> processor written in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> for OS X and iOS. It is a translation/port of the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/">MarkdownSharp</a> processor used by the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/introducing-markdownsharp/">Stack Overflow</a> website.</p>

Repository: <a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/Markingbird">https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/Markingbird</a></p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/Markingbird/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for details on how to use it, and some of the details of how the C# code was translated to Swift.</p>
<p>I can't claim much credit for this project. It is really just a line-by-line translation of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/introducing-markdownsharp/">Jeff Atwood's C# code</a> into Swift. The result is not very pretty, as the C# code is itself based upon translations of Perl and PHP code. I don't recommend this as an example of how to write Swift code, but it does seem to work, and so I hope it is valuable to somebody someday.</p>
<p>This project was useful to me in that it let me write a lot of Swift code without thinking too much about it. It helped me develop Swift-editing muscle memory, quick scanning and correction of Swift syntax issues, and interpretation of the Swift compiler's not-always-helpful error messages. I thought about giving up a few times, as manual translation of 1,800 lines of C# and regular expressions wasn't a great way to spend nights and weekends, but I just couldn't leave it partially finished.</p>
<p>I did the translation by just copying and pasting the C# code into Xcode, and then fixing whatever was wrong. This was a real workout for Xcode 6 beta 5, as the SourceKitService or Xcode itself would often crash or lock up when it encountered C# code.</p>
<p>The most annoying and fiddly part of the process was translating the C# regular-expression strings into Swift. It would be nice if Swift had a "raw" string literal like other languages do, but it doesn't, so I manually transformed each regular expression into a Swift/NSRegularExpression-compatible form. Sublime Text's multiple-selection feature was really helpful for this. I probably could have written some sort of a script to automate the translations, but actually looking at every line was valuable in finding edge cases.</p>
<p>I also discovered a few differences between .NET regular expressions and Cocoa regular expressions. For example, in .NET you can use <code>[ ]</code> (a single space between square brackets) to mean a single space, but <code>NSRegularExpression</code> won't accept this, so I had to use <code>\\p{Z}</code> instead. Also, if a regular expression pattern ends with a <code>|</code> character, .NET apparently ignores it, but <code>NSRegularExpression</code> just lets it match empty strings.</p>
<p>Some of the messiest code that I wrote myself (rather than simply translating) is code that manipulates individual characters and substrings. Swift's <code>String</code> type can make this difficult, due to its extensive Unicode support, so I found myself going back and forth between using <code>String</code> and <code>NSString</code> for string manipulation. The automatic bridging between those two types provided by Swift makes it pretty easy, but it would be nice if somebody made a library of utility functions for dealing with <code>String</code>. (BTW, I strongly recommend that all Swift programmers read Ole Begemann's <a href="http://oleb.net/blog/2014/07/swift-strings/">Strings in Swift</a> article to find out what's going on with <code>String</code>.)</p>
<p>As of now, the <code>SimpleTests</code> test suite from MarkdownSharp works. I plan to port the remaining unit tests from MarkdownSharp, and add a few tests of my own. There are also a few TODOs left in the code that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>I make no promises about the robustness or performance of Markingbird. If you find problems, please submit issues and pull requests via GitHub.</p>
<p>I know some people will want to tell me that using regular expressions for this is bad, and this should be a real parser written in pure Swift. I agree completely: let me know when you have implemented that, and I'll post links to it.</p>                </article>
