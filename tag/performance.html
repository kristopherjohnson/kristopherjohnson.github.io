</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In my copious free time, I've been working on a videogame for the iPad. Friends and family may interject here that it seems like I'm <em>always</em> working on a videogame in my free time, but I've never actually finished one. This time is different. Really.</p>
<p>All of my personal projects are intended primarily to be interesting and fun for me. I gave myself a couple of technical constraints to keep things challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the code is well-factored idiomatic Objective-C. Unlike a lot of iPhone/iPad game programmers, I'm not writing all the guts in low-level C or C++ and then sprinkling a minimal amount of Cocoa on top to interface with the OS.</li>
<li>I'm using Core&nbsp;Animation as my "engine", rather than the OpenGL ES API or an off-the-shelf gaming engine. (Note: My game only needs a couple dozen sprites.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, things have worked out well. I was worried that using Objective-C and Core&nbsp;Animation might lead to performance issues on the iPad, but that hasn't been the case. I have run into a couple of issues with Core&nbsp;Animation that were pretty easy to fix.
<!--break--></p>
<h3>Layer Creation Is Expensive</h3>
<p>My game's "sprites" are just Core&nbsp;Animation layers. When I initially implemented the game, I was creating layers and adding them to the view as needed, and then deleting them when they were no longer needed. This turned out to cause problems; a few frames would get dropped whenever a layer was created.</p>
<p>The fix for this was to create a pool of layers and add them all to the view at startup, and reuse those layers as needed. Unused layers get their <code>hidden</code> property set false.</p>
<h3>Watch Out for Misaligned Images</h3>
<p>If you run an app with Instruments with the Core Animation tool, it has an option to highlight "misaligned images." I couldn't find a lot of information on this, but apparently if you give layers positions that are not perfectly aligned to pixels, Core Animation does some anti-aliasing when rendering those layers, which degrades performance.</p>
<p>The easy fix is to just round all positions to whole pixels, via something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- (void) setSpritePosition:(CGPoint)position {
    CGPoint alignedPosition;
    alignedPosition.x = floorf(0.5f + position.x);
    alignedPosition.y = floorf(0.5f + position.y);
    sprite.position = alignedPosition;
}
</pre></div>


<p>This got rid of most of my misaligned images, but I do still have some sprites that get rotated or scaled via a transform, and such images are always misaligned, unless they are rotated by some multiple of 90 degrees. Thankfully, I only have a few such sprites.</p>                </article>
