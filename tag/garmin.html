</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I recently purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-GPS-Enabled-Sport-Monitor/dp/B003JTLKIA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389711829&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=garmin+forerunner+110+red">Garmin Forerunner 110</a> GPS watch to track my runs. I've been happy with it, but today when I plugged it into my computer after a run, the watch screen flashed "Saving activity" and then went blank. The watch was dead after that.</p>
<p>It had been fully charged before my run, so I was pretty sure it wasn't just out of juice. The instructions provided with the watch weren't helpful.</p>
<p>This blank-screen issue appears to be a common problem. The <a href="https://forums.garmin.com/showthread.php?10639-Forerunner-110-Blank-Screen-(Dead)">Forerunner 110 Blank Screen (Dead)</a> thread in the Garmin forums has over 100 entries. You can browse that thread for details, but here is a summary of the suggested fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold down the Light, Start/Stop, and Lap/Reset buttons for about 30 seconds. (This worked for me.)</li>
<li>Hold down all four buttons for about 7 seconds. (Didn't work for me.)</li>
<li>Hold down the Light button for about 6 seconds. (Didn't work for me.)</li>
<li>Hold down the "Power" button while plugging it into the computer. (My watch doesn't have a button labeled "Power". I tried this with the Light button, and with the Page/Menu button, but neither worked.)</li>
<li>Plug it into a different USB port. (Didn't work for me.)</li>
<li>Just leave it plugged in for a few days, and eventually it will spring back to life.</li>
<li>Rub the contacts with a pencil eraser.</li>
<li>Attach the USB clip, but don't attach the clip to a USB port, and hold the Light button for 6 seconds.</li>
<li>Check whether there is a <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/firmware">firmware update</a> available.</li>
<li>Try a <a href="http://support.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId=%7B0439fb90-a761-11e0-d01c-000000000000%7D">master reset</a>.</li>
<li>Contact Garmin Customer Support.</li>
<li>Take the watch back to where you bought it for replacement/refund.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I got it working, i checked for a <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/firmware">firmware update</a>, and indeed there was a new firmware version available for the Forerunner 110. This is in the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes from version 2.60 to version 2.70:</p>
<p>Fixed an issue where the device could display a blank screen while connected to the charger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I installed the update. I'll have to wait to see whether the problem recurs.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-01-23:</strong> The screen went blank again. Hold down the Light, Start/Stop, and Lap/Reset buttons got it working.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-03-09:</strong> Blank again, and the above remedies weren't working. The recharging display did appear when I connect it to USB, but it wouldn't do anything when disconnected. I let it sit disconnected for a few hours, and it sprung to life.</p>                </article>
