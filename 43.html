</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Another year older. I'm solidly in my forties now. It's not too bad.</p>
<p>We've had a few additions to the family in the past year: we bought two more Yorkshire Terriers, named <em>Boo</em> and <em>Tweezer</em>. About a week and half ago, Boo gave birth to a puppy whom we've named <em>Sparky</em>. He hasn't opened his eyes yet, but he's growing fast. So we now have four dogs, which is more than we really want, but I doubt we'll be able to part with any of them.</p>
<p>I've lost thirty pounds this year. I'd like to lose another twenty, but I'm glad I haven't regained what I've lost. As a result of the weight loss and diet, I no longer need medication to control hypertension or cholesterol. So I'm healthier than I was last year, and I hope that trend continues.</p>
<p>My wife decided to put a patio in the backyard this summer. The project grew a little beyond its initial scope, but the result is that we have a really nice backyard now. I like to go out there and read on weekends. It makes our little house feel a little bigger. I still really like it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlonega,_Georgia">Dahlonega</a>.</p>
<p>I notice in my "42" entry that I said my career was in a rut, and it still is. However, I will have some opportunity to learn new things at work this year, so while it's still not what I want, at least it won't be completely boring.</p>
<p>Usually when I write my birthday blog post, I can review the last year's worth of blog postings to remind me of the things I did during the year. Unfortunately, this year I decided to limit my blog postings to programming- and technology-related topics, so I don't have a record of the really interesting things that have happened. But I do know that I'm happy, and that's all that really matters.</p>
