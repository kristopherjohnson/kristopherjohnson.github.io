When I first started dating my fiancee, she made fun of my Macs.  I told her I'd convince her to buy one herself someday.  Her response: <i>NEVER!!!</i>
</p>

<p>
She kept that stance until she bought an iPhone.  Then she started looking more closely at the Mac, saying stuff like "I really like that interface," and "I like how it turns on instantly when you open it."
</p>

<p>
Then she saw that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a> commercial - the one where the computer fits in a manila envelope.  For the first few weeks, she said it was cool, but she didn't really need one.  About a week ago, she started trying to convince me that it would be a practical purchase.  (I didn't need convincing; she was really trying to convince herself.)
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, she bought a MacBook Air.
</p>

<p>
However, I can't really savor my victory.  I'm too jealous of her new toy.
