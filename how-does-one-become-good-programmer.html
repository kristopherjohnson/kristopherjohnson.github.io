</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This is a quote I like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The really good programmers spend a lot of time programming. I haven't seen very good programmers who don't spend a lot of time programming. If I don't program for two or three days, I need to do it. And you get better at it&mdash;you get quicker at it. The side effect of writing all this other stuff is that when you get to doing ordinary problems, you can do them very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's from Joe Armstrong, creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29">Erlang</a>, in Peter Seibel's <em><a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/">Coders at Work</a></em> (which, by the way, every programmer should read).</p>
<p>This jibes with what I've seen over the years. Really good programmers don't treat coding as a nine-to-five job. It's something they want to do whether they are being paid for it or not.</p>
<p>A very easy way to weed out bad candidates when interviewing is to ask them about their personal programming projects. If they don't have any, then I'm pretty sure I don't want to work with them.</p>
<p>In this respect, programming is little different from other creative pursuits. You become a good writer by writing a lot; you become a good sculptor by sculpting a lot; you become a good musician by playing music a lot.</p>
<p>So go out there and write some code. That's what I'm about to do.</p>
