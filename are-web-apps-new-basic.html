</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I often wonder how kids today get into programming. When I was a kid, and got my first computer, I spent a lot of time typing in the programs from David Ahl's <em><a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/">BASIC Computer Games</a></em>. After typing in the code for the games and playing them a bit, I'd start changing them. Eventually, I got into 6502 assembly language and higher-level programming languages, but that early exposure to a bunch of simple BASIC programs is what got me started as a coder.</p>
<p>Today, kids are surrounded by programmable computers, but few of them learn how to write code. Most kids are no more interested in programming a computer than they would be in rebuilding a car's engine. I don't see a lot of simple projects like those in Ahl's book that they can play with and start hacking on. How does a kid get started?</p>
<p>There are programming environments that are intended to teach kids programming (<a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, <a href="http://www.alice.org/">Alice</a>, etc.). But use of those is not widespread, and I question their usefulness. All the good programmers I know started with something primitive, like BASIC, Fortran, Perl, or command.com. I wonder if somebody can really learn how computers work by working with fancy 3D "authoring environments" like Alice and Squeak.</p>
<p>It's occurred to me that web applications might be one way to get into programming. Web browsers are as ubiquitous as BASIC was in the 80's. It's relatively easy for a kid to set up a web site with Drupal or some other off-the-shelf CMS, and then start customizing it. All they need is Notepad and an Internet connection. They learn a little CSS here, a little JavaScript there, and pretty soon they'd rather be coding than playing games. </p>
<p>Is there a web-app equivalent to <em>BASIC Computer Games</em>? If not, there should be.</p>
