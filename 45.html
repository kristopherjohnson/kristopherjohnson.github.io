</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It's another one of those "5" years. I'm now halfway to 90. 90 sounds old, but once upon a time, 45 sounded old too.</p>
<p>The year has not been easy. We lost my maternal grandmother, <a href="http://nerofuneralhome.net/fh/obituaries/obituary.cfm?o_id=1238522&amp;fh_id=13570">Ann Woods</a>, in August. I have many good memories of time spent with her up in North Dakota.</p>
<p>My brother announced that he and his wife were getting a divorce. Again, not happy news, but we have to accept it. The end-of-year family get-togethers have seemed incomplete without my sister-in-law.</p>
<p>However, even with those events, this year has been a pretty good one for me.</p>
<p>Professionally, things have been better than usual. I developed Real Professional mobile apps for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/udot-traffic/id477093147?mt=8">iPhone/iPad</a> and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.transcore.android.commuterLink&amp;hl=en">Android</a>. These apps have over 30,000 users, and they have been well received. Most applications I've developed during my career had only a few dozen users, so this larger reach gives me a sense that I can have some sort of effect on the world.</p>
<p>I've wanted to make iPhone and iPad software since I was 12 years old. Unfortunately, iPhones and iPads didn't exist back then. I'm glad that the devices are finally here, and that they pay me to work with them.</p>
<p>One resolution I've made for the coming year is to spend at least one hour per day working on personal programming projects. I gave up programming "for fun" a few years ago when work was burning me out, but now my interest has been rekindled.</p>
<p>I started meditating almost-daily about 12 months ago. For this, I credit 5by5's <a href="http://5by5.tv/person/dan-benjamin">Dan Benjamin</a>, who mentioned his <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/an-introduction-to-mindfulness-meditation/">meditation practice</a> on several podcasts. I'm no zen master, but I do feel less stress and it's easier to ignore all the little problems in my life. I only have a mental breakdown two or three times a day now.</p>
<p>The optometrist prescribed progressive lenses for me this year. I don't like having old-people glasses, but I'm glad that my corrected eyesight is better. I wish I'd gotten these years ago.</p>
<p>Life with my wife and stepson keeps getting better. Bailey has matured and calmed down a lot over the past year&mdash;we actually see him smile once in a while! Pebble hasn't had to spend any time in the hospital this year, which makes us both feel a lot better. Our five dogs are all healthy and happy. Our little cabin in the foothills is still the nicest place I've ever been.</p>
<p>I don't like getting older, but as long as the years keep getting better, I won't complain about it.</p>
