    <p>Kris developed an early interest in computers. His father worked for IBM, and Kris fondly remembers visits to Daddy's office to see all the glowing screens. At the age of 13, Kris received an Atari 800 computer for Christmas, and quickly taught himself Basic and assembly language so that he could create videogames and make fun of Commodore users.</p>
<p>During college, Kris got a Macintosh SE/30, which is the greatest personal computer of all time.</p>
<p>Kris has been a professional software developer since 1992. Right out of college, he went to work for a traffic-engineering firm, and worked on traffic control and monitoring systems for New York City, New York State, Maryland, the County of Los Angeles, and other state and local governments. He got a lot of experience writing cross-platform code for heterogeneous environments that included OpenVMS, UNIX, OS/2, VxWorks, and Windows.</p>
<p>For the past few years, Kris has been working in the gaming industry, developing systems for lotteries, race tracks, and casinos. Most of this work has been in C++, but he's also done some work in C# and Python.</p>
<p>In 2006, Kris founded <em><a href="http://capablehands.net">Capable Hands Technologies, Inc.</a></em>. Since then, the bulk of his time has been spent doing contract work for a former employer, but he's made a little money doing other things.</p>
<p>When he is not working for employers or clients, Kris likes to experiment with a lot of programming languages and design techniques. Most of these experiments have no direct relation to "real work," but Kris knows that exposure to different paradigms improves programming and problem-solving abilities in all contexts.</p>
<p>Kris is currently concentrating on learning more about Mac OS X Cocoa and iPhone Cocoa Touch development. He has sold and distributed iPhone applications through Apple's App Store. This hasn't made him rich yet, but he's optimistic.</p>
<p>In 2007, Kris met a wonderful woman named <em>Pebble</em>, and in 2008 they married. Kris currently lives in northern Georgia with Pebble, stepson Bailey, and five little dogs. He's very happy there.</p>
<p>Kris enjoys writing about himself in the third person.</p>
