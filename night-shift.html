The team I'm working with is involved in installing a new system in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_australia">South Australia</a>.  A few people are on site in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, but most of us are still back here in Georgia, USA.
</p>

<p>
South Australia is thirteen-and-a-half hours ahead of US Eastern time.  This has made it difficult to provide support from home, as they work while we sleep and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
We came up with a solution:  the people in the States will be working from 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM, which is 4:30 AM to 12:30 AM in Adelaide.  The people in Australia will show up at 7:00 AM their time (which is the earliest they are allowed into the building), giving us a few hours of overlapping duty.
</p>

<p>
So, this week I get to see my wife and stepson for just a few minutes each morning (as they prepare for school/work) and each evening (when I get home around midnight).  That stinks, but I guess it's better than traveling to Australia myself.
</p>

<p>
(I know some people will chime in and say "Oh, you've got to go to Australia!  It's wonderful!"  You people obviously aren't IT workers.  If I go to Australia for this project, all I will get to see is the airport, the hotel, and the basement where they keep the computers.  Sightseeing is for people in Business Development.)
