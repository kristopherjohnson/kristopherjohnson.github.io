The term "death march" is commonly used for software projects that are behind schedule, over budget, have no end in sight, and yet must be completed.  There is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-March-2nd-Yourdon-Press/dp/013143635X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200486804&sr=8-1">book</a> with that title.
</p>

<p>
I've recently become involved in one of these projects.  I should say "re-involved," because I was involved with the project a year and a half ago, and I quit.  As an independent contractor now, I feel less pain than the employees do: I get paid by the hour and can set my own schedule, whereas they have to work unpaid overtime, and they are shackled to their desks.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, one of the developers had to go to a doctor.  The stress and long hours had led to high pulse rate and other signs of anxiety.  The doctor told him to go home and get some rest, which he did.
</p>

<p>
We're all glad that nothing more serious happened.  Managers express surprise that anyone would work himself so hard.  I've only been involved with this for a few days, but here's what I've observed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Requirements and UI design are still changing.</li>
<li>Work that was originally estimated to take three months has now been scheduled for completion in three weeks.</li>
<li>A manager stops by every hour to get a status update.</li>
<li>There are a couple of hour-long meetings every day.  Plans are changed during each meeting.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yeah, I can't imagine why anyone would feel pressure, with management being so "helpful."
</p>

<p>
He's young.  I remember when I was younger.  I tried to meet crazy deadlines.  I took it personally when managers demanded faster progress.  I blamed myself for everything that went wrong.  I worked myself sick.
</p>

<p>
Now, with a couple of decades of seasoning, I know better.  If you're involved in a death march, it is due to your managers' incompetence, not yours.  Work at a sustainable pace, and remember that no matter how loudly the managers are screaming, there is no need to sacrifice yourself for the good of the company.
