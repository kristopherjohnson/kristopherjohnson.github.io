<p>Version 1.1 of JacksOrBetter for the iPhone and iPod&nbsp;Touch is now available, and it's still free. If you have an iPhone or iPod&nbsp;Touch, you can get it from <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jacksorbetter-video-poker/id290542821?mt=8">the App&nbsp;Store</a>.</p>
<p>This version has a lot of cosmetic improvements over version 1.0. Version 1.0 was, frankly, a little embarrassing, and I'm glad I finally got around to fixing it.</p>
<p>I created JacksOrBetter back in September 2008, when the App Store had only existed for a couple of months, and the iPhone App&nbsp;Store Gold&nbsp;Rush was on. The news was full of stories of iPhone developers who were making tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars from simple games. I wanted in on that action.</p>
<p>JacksOrBetter wasn't intended to make me a fortune; it was my first learning-how-to-write-an-iPhone-app exercise. I figured I'd whip it out, learn what I needed to learn to make and sell an iPhone app, and then I'd get to work on the apps I <em>really</em> wanted to write. (Those other apps are still in the conceptual stage, a year and a half later.)</p>
<p>At that time, there were only a few hundred apps in the App Store, and many were little better than JacksOrBetter. I initially charged $1.99 for it, and after a couple of weeks dropped the price to $0.99. I made about $280 over the next few months. Initially I was selling a dozen or so copies per day, but sales eventually fell to only a few per week, so I decided to make it free.</p>
<p>Since then, I've seen a lot of really nice iPhone apps, and I've learned a lot more about how to make them, so I finally decided to sit down and make JacksOrBetter what it should have been.</p>
<p>So now, it has nicer looking cards, a nicer background, and some cool animations of cards being dealt, discarded, and cleared at the end.</p>
<p>It's still pretty simple, but it no longer has that first-app stink.</p>
<p>There are a few more changes I want to make, but I've got this idea for an iPad&nbsp;app...</p>
