Last week, I had my first complete physical exam in twenty years.  I figured that, because I'm 40, I ought to get one.  I was wondering what problems they might find.
</p>

<p>
EKG, heart sounds, lungs, reflexes, and everything were fine.  However, my blood pressure was high.  It was also high when I had my aviation exam, and both my parents have high blood pressure, so I finally had to accept the fact that I have a problem that probably can't be solved with rest, exercise, and a good diet.  The doctor prescribed a daily dosage of blood pressure control medication.
</p>

<p>
<i>Medication</i>.  In one sense, it's no big deal; lots of people are on medication.  But, for the first time, I've been prescribed a daily dosage that I'll probably have to take for the rest of my life.
</p>

<p>
Does this make me officially middle-aged?
</p>

<p>
UPDATE:  This means that if I want to fly again, I'll have to get cleared by the FAA medical staff again, which is a 4-to-6-week procedure.  My medication is one that is approved by the FAA, but they review such things on a case-by-case basis.
