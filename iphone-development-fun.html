I am so thankful for the existence of the iPhone.  Twenty years ago, if you'd told me I'd be holding a pocket-sized computer that had a high-resolution touchscreen, a wireless always-on connection to the Internet, and a library of Hollywood movies, I wouldn't have believed it.  The fact that it can make phone calls is nice too, but I frankly don't care too much about that feature.  All those idiots who keep asking "Why would anyone spend $500 on a <em>phone</em>?!?" are really missing the point.
</p>

<p>
(See <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=iphone">The iPhone is a piece of shit, and so is your face</a> for an alternative opinion.)
</p>

<p>
Writing little apps for the iPhone is the only thing keeping me from giving up on software completely. (Well, OK, I guess the mortgage has something to do with that also.)  At work, I'm starting my third year of maintaining a horrible soul-crushing legacy application, and it's hard for me to maintain the appropriate level of Give-a-Shit.  Playing with the iPhone SDK helps.
</p>

<p>
I'm working on an application now that I hope to put in the App Store in a few weeks.  No, it's not <a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2008/12/to-do-list-application-update-1.html">my to-do list app</a>.  I'd rather not write about it yet, because it is the kind of thing someone else could create during an uninterrupted weekend, but once it's done, I'll start the marketing.
</p>

<p>
My first app, <a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2008/11/jacksorbetter-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch.html">JacksOrBetter</a>, has not been wildly successful.  I've sold about 200 copies worldwide.  That's not surprising, as it's a simple game, and there are a few dozen other casino-style card games available in the App Store, many of which are free.  I didn't expect to make money with that game; I just wanted to go through the process of developing something and putting it up for sale.
</p>

<p>
I doubt my next app will bring in a windfall either, but that's fine with me.  I'm having fun, and people are using software I've written.  That's why I got into this business in the first place.
