  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>After my last permanent position, I took a few months off from work, and
then tried to start a career as an independent consultant/contractor.
After many years of hearing about the freedom enjoyed by consultants,
and the exhorbitant fees they charged, I wanted to get my piece of the
action. People encouraged me to give it a try, because I had many of the
traits associated with independents: desire for variety, lots of
knowledge, no trouble voicing my opinions, and no dependents who would
go hungry if I couldn't find work.</p>
<p>My primary motivation was the desire to be independent. I wanted that
whole be-you-own-boss thing. I wanted to be able to work less than 40
hours a week when I felt like it. I wanted to be able to choose which
assignments to take. I wanted to be able to decide what new computer to
buy and which development tools to use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was mid 2002, and as all you people more clued into
reality than me know, that was a bad time to try to start a contracting
career. Established contractors were having trouble finding work. Those
who were finding work had to charge fractions of what they used to
charge.</p>
<p>The biggest reason I failed as a contractor was that I didn't have the
business sense for it. I didn't know anything about marketing. I didn't
know what my market niche would be. I didn't have a lot of contacts in
the industry. I hoped I could just post my resumé on my web site, and
jobs would start rolling in.</p>
<p>I did get a few calls, but most of them were for things that I wasn't
really prepared to do. For example, my resume lists Oracle and OpenVMS.
I was contacted by someone who needed me to provide training for
employees who would be administering Oracle on an OpenVMS system. Ten
years ago, when Oracle on OpenVMS was what I was doing, I may have been
able to do it, but it had been so long that I didn't think I could do a
reasonable job, so I had to pass. There were several other similar
opportunities that I passed on as well.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I wonder if I should have taken a few of those jobs. I
wouldn't have known what I was doing, but it would have been work and it
could have led to something I knew better. I have never been comfortable
claiming to be able to do things that I don't really know I can do.
Other consultants don't have that problem.</p>
<p>I did manage to land a contract with a former employer. They did pay me
well, but unfortunately only had a few hours of work per month for me to
do.</p>
<p>Eventually, I gave up on the idea of being completely independent, and
signed up with one of those organizations that hires people out as
contractors. I got a good gig with them, but for no more money than I
would have received as a permanent employee, and without security or
benefits.</p>
<p>So, I gave up on contracting, and got a permanent job.</p>
<p>Will I ever go independent or start my own business again? Maybe. I
think I do have a strong entrepreneurial streak, and a disdain for
working at the direction of others. But I'm not going to try it again
until I have a better idea about what products or services I will
provide, and who will pay for them.</p>
