&lt;p&gt;For several years, my blog has been running on Drupal 6.  Drupal &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/04/18/drupal-rocks"&gt;seemed like …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've moved this blog from a &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; CMS running on an AWS EC2 instance to a statically generated set of pages hosted on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.  If you're curious about the reasons and the process, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years, my blog has been running on Drupal 6.  Drupal &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/04/18/drupal-rocks"&gt;seemed like a good idea when I started&lt;/a&gt;, as it was a mature easy-to-use content management system, but I've been wanting to get away from it for a while.  I spend more time maintaining Drupal then I do writing articles for the blog.  When I started I had to do &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2010/11/12/setting-drupal-6-ubuntu-1010-ec2"&gt;a lot of work&lt;/a&gt; to get Drupal configured and running well.  There are always new versions and security updates to apply, and I really should have upgraded to Drupal 7 and then Drupal 8 somewhere along the way, but I haven't and now I can't update to newer versions of Ubuntu. The care and feeding of Drupal is just too much work for the benefits it provides for my simple blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to move to a static site generator, as I don't need dynamic features and I want to avoid the pain of setting up any more CMSes or blogging engines on any server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My basic requirements for the new generator were these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a similar front page layout, with a list of ten "teasers" from most recent entries, a list of archives, an "About" page, and a few links to other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support existing URLs for existing pages, so people who used my blog before can still find things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to run the generator on my laptop and easily upload the generated static pages to my Apache web server, or S3, or GitHub Pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let me write posts in &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Drupal 6 Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first step was to export the existing articles and metadata from the Drupal database on my blog server, and recreate it on my development machine.  Looking at my Drupal configuration, I was able to find the database name and login information (which I forgot years ago).  I used &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; to export the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mysqldump --user=$dbuser --password=$dbpass --tz-utc --databases &amp;quot;drupal6_undefinedvalue&amp;quot; &amp;gt; &amp;quot;drupal6_undefinedvalue.sql&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, after copying the file to my dev machine, I loaded it with the MySQL command &lt;code&gt;source drupal6_undefinedvalue.sql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than reading Drupal source code or documentation, I just used a lot of MySQL "show tables", "describe", and &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; commands to figure out the database schema.  These are the tables and columns that I found useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;: metadata about all the Drupal "nodes", or pages&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nid&lt;/code&gt;: node ID (primary key)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;story&lt;/code&gt;.  My blog posts are all of type &lt;code&gt;story&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;: the original title of the post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;: 0 for an unpublished post, or 1 for a published post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;created&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;changed&lt;/code&gt;: timestamps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;node_revisions&lt;/code&gt;: the content of each node&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nid&lt;/code&gt;: node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;: current title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;: main content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;: foreign key into the &lt;code&gt;filter_formats&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;filter_formats&lt;/code&gt;: list of filter formats for posts&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;: key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;: "Filtered HTML", "Full HTML", "Filtered Markdown", or "Full Markdown"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;term_node&lt;/code&gt;: association of posts with tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;term_data&lt;/code&gt;: tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;url_alias&lt;/code&gt;: provides mappings from URLs like "node/288" to "2017/04/22/my-first-chess-program"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; of a &lt;code&gt;node_revisions&lt;/code&gt; record contains a special token &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; between the "teaser" portion and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a Python script that could extract the relevant fields from these tables and print out the attributes I expected to see.  If you are interested in seeing it, check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/drupal6tostatic"&gt;my drupal6tostatic repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Static Site Generators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to decide on a static site generator to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A "static site generator" (SSG) is a program that, given a bunch of input files and templates and configuration files and code, will generate a tree of static HTML pages that can be uploaded to a web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly thought about writing my own SSG, but my goal here is to get my blog moved as quickly and painlessly as possible, so I decided to go with an off-the-shelf solution.  The most popular SSG is currently &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't like Ruby much and would prefer a Python 3-based tool.  After doing a brief survey of the available Python SSGs, I decided to give these a try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus"&gt;Cactus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://hyde.github.io"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cactus didn't work with Python 3. It almost worked, but the blog plugin wasn't compatible with Python 3, and after I fixed that, it generated an empty index page.  With Python 2, it worked, but its blog plugin didn't support the directory hierarchy I wanted to maintain.  Rather than fix these issues, I moved on to the next candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyde didn't support Python 3. (The website says Python 3 support is "in progress".)  I gave it a try anyway, and while I didn't hate it, I really want something that works with Python 3 and doesn't require a lot of configuration.  (For every YAML file I see, I expect at least one hour of messing around with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican worked pretty well on my first try (except for a CRITICAL error when running &lt;code&gt;pelican generate&lt;/code&gt; with a not-well-formed Markdown file) and it seemed to be the most well-documented and well-supported of the generators I tried.  Out-of-the-box, it handled pagination and other desirable features that would have required configuration or additional coding in Cactus or Hyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to go with Pelican as my site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python 3 Virtual Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure I'd be able to easily run the Pelican generator on any machine, now or in the future, I set up a Python 3 &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/venv.html"&gt;virtual environment&lt;/a&gt; and installed the necessary packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;python3 -m venv-pelican-blog                # create the environment
source venv-pelican-blog/bin/activate       # activate the environment
pip install pelican pelican-alias markdown  # install dependencies
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And then before running any Pelican commands, I have to make sure I run the command &lt;code&gt;source venv-pelican-blog/bin/activate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuring Pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support automatic redirects from old URLs to the new pages, I installed the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nitron/pelican-alias"&gt;pelican-alias&lt;/a&gt; plugin, and updated my generator script so that it would include an &lt;code&gt;Alias:&lt;/code&gt; item for each old article.  I also gave all my blog posts a Category of "Blog", so that category name appears as a menu option at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added an &lt;code&gt;about-me.md&lt;/code&gt; file to the &lt;code&gt;content/pages&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory, so that would also appear at the top of the page as it does in the Drupal site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set the &lt;code&gt;LINKS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SOCIAL&lt;/code&gt; settings in &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; so that I would get lists of links similar to what was in the Drupal blog's "blocks".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set the &lt;code&gt;YEAR_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MONTH_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DAY_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS&lt;/code&gt; variables in &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; to generate archive pages with paths identical to what was used in Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theme and Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wanted a theme similar to that of the &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/whitejazz"&gt;WhiteJazz&lt;/a&gt; theme I had used with Drupal 6.  Pelican comes with two built-in themes: &lt;code&gt;simple&lt;/code&gt;, which is basically just plain text with no styling, and &lt;code&gt;notmyidea&lt;/code&gt;, which is what the &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;getpelican.com&lt;/a&gt; website uses.  Rather than perusing all the other themes available for Pelican, I decided to try to replicate WhiteJazz myself, with the expectatation that I would give up in frustruation after a few hours and look for an off-the-shelf theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it turned out to be easier than I expected to create my own theme.  Basically, I just copied the &lt;code&gt;simple&lt;/code&gt; theme files to a new directory, then updated the templates that didn't quite do what I wanted, and added some CSS.  For the basic CSS, I chose &lt;a href="http://getskeleton.com"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, a simple CSS framework which I had used before in my &lt;a href="http://secretspacelab.com/tcm.html"&gt;What's Good on TCM?&lt;/a&gt; site.  It was easy to set up its grid to provide the basic layout of WhiteJazz.  I then added my own CSS rules and template customizations, borrowing liberally from the WhiteJazz CSS and notmyidea templates, until I had what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem I ran into was that the &lt;code&gt;simple&lt;/code&gt; framework had an empty (0 bytes) &lt;code&gt;tag.html&lt;/code&gt; template, and was missing other files related to tags.  So I copied the missing files from &lt;code&gt;notmyidea&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publishing the New Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already set up my personal &lt;code&gt;kristopherjohnson.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repo as a GitHub Pages site.  It was a simple index.html that redirected to the Undefined Value home page.  I set up a Makefile rule that would copy the output from Pelican to my local repo, commit the change, and then push that repo to GitHub.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all I have to do to regenerate the site and push it to the cloud is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cd ~/work/undefinedvalue-pelican
source venv-pelican-blog/bin/activate
make github
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It takes about four seconds to run &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt;.  After that, it takes a minute or two before the changes are actually visible on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I went to my domain registrar and updated the &lt;code&gt;undefinedvalue.com&lt;/code&gt; address records so it now points to GitHub rather than to my old server, following the instructions on these pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/"&gt;Quick start: Setting up a custom domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/"&gt;Setting up an apex domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've wanted to do this migration for over a year, but feared it would take up a few weekends and be full of frustration.  It was actually a lot easier than I expected.  The hardest part for me was getting the CSS right.  But it feels good that I figured out how to do a full conversion by writing a few scripts and modifying some configuration files and templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I miss is the simplicity of editing with Drupal.  If I saw a typo on the site, I could just click an &lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt; button, fix it, and &lt;em&gt;Save&lt;/em&gt;.  Now if I see something wrong, I have to find the right input file in my tree of files, edit it, and then republish, and then wait a few minutes to see if it looks right.  But I am very happy to no longer be dependent upon a MySQL database, an old version of a PHP-based CMS, and an EC2 web server.&lt;/p&gt;

That was back when the average personal-computer chess program wasn't very good, and dedicated chess computers cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, so it seemed to me that chess was something very difficult for computers to do.  At the time, many experts still thought a computer would never be able to beat human grandmasters.  I dreamed that I would one day write The World's Greatest Chess Program, and that would prove I was a great computer programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one's priorities change.  I did look into how chess programs worked when I was in college, and while I found the topic interesting, I didn't try writing my own program.  I still thought that writing a chess program was something every Real Computer Programmer should do, but I didn't get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, at age 50, I've finally done it.  A few weeks ago I started writing a chess engine in &lt;a href="https://swift.org"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;, and it is now capable of playing a real chess game. I call it "kjchess".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works, but it's slow.  On my 2013 MacBook Pro, my move search function can only search about four half-moves deep to find a move in a reasonable time, even when using all the CPU cores.  That is terrible, considering that it is worse than the 4MHz 8-bit &lt;a href="http://www.spacious-mind.com/html/classic.html"&gt;Fidelity "Classic" chess computer&lt;/a&gt; I had 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is my engine so slow?  I initially gave myself a few constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it in "high-level" Swift (that is, it shouldn't look like a C or C++ program).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it in a functional-programming style (in particular, use immutable data structures wherever possible).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't refer to any other chess programs' source code.  Use only the knowledge of chess programming I've gleaned over the last few decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These constraints made it an interesting exercise, but I relaxed them.  For example, I copied the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha–beta_pruning"&gt;minimax algorthm with alpha-beta pruning&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia, and I've incorporated some positional evaluation ideas from &lt;a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Simplified+evaluation+function"&gt;the Chess Programming Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've seen how slow it is, I think I need to abandon the "only immutable data structures" constraint.  I think the main reason my engine is so slow is that it creates a brand-new "position" structure for every possible move, leading to a lot of memory allocation, deallocation, and copying, whereas other engines have a single global position on which they make and unmake moves very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, my engine doesn't save any search state between moves, and it doesn't do any pondering during the opponent's move.  I could probably make it a lot better by adding those features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its limitations, it plays well enough to beat me once in a while.  That's not impressive, because I am a terrible chess player, but I figure I'm a winner either way. (I'm also a loser either way, but I can ignore that.)&lt;/p&gt;

I skipped my last &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/category/tags/birthday"&gt;annual birthday update&lt;/a&gt;.  Something important was going on in January and I wanted to wait until it got resolved before writing the update, but by the time it was resolved it seemed too late to be an annual update.  So I have a bit of time to cover since &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2015/01/30/48"&gt;my last update at 48&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I also need an updated picture. That picture in the corner of this web page is from several years ago. I'm much better looking now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year we've moved into a ranch-style house with a big wooded back yard. It's in a nice part of Johns Creek, Georgia, close to everything we need to be close to, about fifteen minutes away from my parents' house.  We finally sold our Dahlonega cabin, so we are thinking about buying this house we're currently renting, and will be working on that in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife Pebble is now a science teacher at Chattahoochee High School.  Bailey is finishing his last year of high school.  We have another young man, De'John, staying with us while he finishes high school as well.  Not sure what either of them will be doing after high school, but I'm sure they will figure something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents are still in Roswell.  Mom has joined Dad in retirement.  Dad has been having some health issues, so I worry about him, but I'm hoping it turns out OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother Eric is engaged to be married. We've enjoyed meeting his fiancée and her kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm starting my third year working at &lt;a href="http://mobilelabsinc.com"&gt;Mobile Labs&lt;/a&gt; as a Senior Software Developer.  It's been interesting work.  I've learned a lot about the internals of iOS and Android, and am starting to get into the reverse-engineering work that attracted me to the position.  I get to write code for iOS, Android, Windows and macOS, in C#, C++, Objective-C, Swift, and other languages.  I work at home three days a week, and go into the office in Buckhead twice a week. We will be expanding our product offerings in the coming year, so I look forward to having a lot of new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into long-distance running a few years ago, running my &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2014/03/24/2014-publix-georgia-marathon"&gt;first marathon&lt;/a&gt; in March 2014.  Unfortunately, a couple of days after that marathon, I was hit with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis"&gt;plantar fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result had to quit running for about a year.  After resuming my running, I still haven't been able to get back into the groove of running more than about six miles.  So I'm setting a goal for this year of running another half marathon, and depending on how that goes, might try another marathon in 2018. I hope to lose about 50 pounds along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My politics have changed and become more important to me in the past couple of years.  I've always favored equality for women and minorities, but my conservative upbringing left me with an underlying assumption that the world is basically a meritocracy, and anybody who works hard enough can achieve the same things I have. And I felt that whatever inequality exists is not my fault, so it wasn't my problem to fix.  I no longer believe those things. Women and minorities simply don't get the same opportunities that white men do, and they face obstacles that white men don't understand or recognize. It's not fair, and we should all want to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've decided that, as a white man with unearned privilege, I have a responsibility to do what I can to help correct these imbalances.  It makes me unpopular with my friends and family at the dinner table and on Facebook, but I will no longer just sit quietly when I hear that all Muslims should be exterminated, or that unarmed black man shot in the back by police probably did something to deserve it, or that women really should dress more modestly if they want to be taken seriously.  We all need to speak up when we hear such things.  I've decided I will speak up, and will do what I can to amplify the voices of those who often go unheard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might make me unpopular, but I don't care.  That's one of the best things about being 50.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="self-indulgence"></category><category term="birthday"></category></entry><entry><title>What's Good on TCM This Week?</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/whats-good-tcm-week.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-04T22:34:41-04:00</published><updated>2016-11-04T22:34:41-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2016-11-04:/whats-good-tcm-week.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like old movies.

In the old days, we had TV stations known as "UHF channels" that showed lots of old movies all night long. But UHF channels are gone, and today all we have is the Turner Classic Movies (TCM) channel and website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like film noir, sci-fi, horror, and westerns. TCM has a lot of these movies, but it also shows a lot of stuff I'm not interested in. I don't like browsing the upcoming schedule via the TCM website or via my cable provider's interface, so I wanted a way to generate a schedule just for me so that I can record good stuff on my DVR, or watch available movies on &lt;a href="http://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/"&gt;Watch TCM&lt;/a&gt; or my cable provider's on-demand service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that TCM offers a &lt;a href="http://www.tcm.com/tcmws/v1/docs/welcome.html"&gt;web services APIs&lt;/a&gt; that allow one to retrieve schedule information. So I've whipped up a script that that grabs the schedule for the next week and identifies the movies that match my preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a web page: &lt;a href="http://secretspacelab.com/tcm.html"&gt;What's Good on TCM?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page displays the movies coming up during the next week that might be "good" according to my taste. You can click the name of a movie or name of a director, actor, or screenwriter to search the TCM database for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your preferences may not match mine. That's OK; if you are a computer person, you might be able to customize my script to find your musicals or romances or screwball comedies or whatever it is you want.

This should keep me busy and out of trouble for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to use the Arduino to read sensors and control the turnout switches on the track, but I think it is easier to use the RPi to do some initial experimentation with driving relays and other electronic components. I did the typical &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/1f3c0e70899766447dd0"&gt;make-an-LED-blink&lt;/a&gt; exercise using the &lt;a href="http://wiringpi.com"&gt;wiringPi&lt;/a&gt; library. It wasn't difficult, but I wished there was an interactive way to play with the &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/README.md"&gt;GPIO&lt;/a&gt; pins, rather than going through a cycle of editing, compiling, and executing a C program whenever I wanted to try something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29"&gt;Forth&lt;/a&gt;. Forth was designed as an interactive language for controlling hardware, and seemed like the perfect solution for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking at a few possibilities for Forth-based solutions, I decided to use &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/"&gt;Gforth&lt;/a&gt;, as it provides a straightforward way to call functions in the wiringPi library without the need to build my own Forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my Gforth interface to the wiringPi library: &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/wiringPi_gforth"&gt;https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/wiringPi_gforth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The application needs to perform some operations that require root privileges (installing and uninstalling launchd daemons, sending signals to other users' processes, etc.) So I started looking for some documentation about how to do that. I figured it would take a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, I finally think I understand it. The solution isn't complicated, but learning about it was difficult for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple's "Authorization Services Programming Guide" is woefully out of date. It tells you to use &lt;code&gt;AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges()&lt;/code&gt;, but that has been deprecated since OS X 10.7. It also has links to sample code that doesn't exist anymore. (Apple developer documentation people: It seems many of your docs are way out of date. Pls fix.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple provides a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/SMJobBless/Introduction/Intro.html"&gt;SMJobBless&lt;/a&gt; sample that purports to demonstrate how to use the new &lt;code&gt;SMJobBless()&lt;/code&gt; API that replaces &lt;code&gt;AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges()&lt;/code&gt;. However, while it does indeed install some kind of service that could in theory run as root, the service it installs doesn't do anything, so it is useless as an example. (But you could waste a lot of time with it before you figure that out.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of old documentation and sample code for the original low-level XPC API is still floating around, but once you have a clue (which I didn't), you'll just use the high-level &lt;code&gt;NSXPCConnection&lt;/code&gt; API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the hope I can help others avoid this tortuous path, here is how i would suggest others learn how to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/EvenBetterAuthorizationSample/Listings/Read_Me_About_EvenBetterAuthorizationSample_txt.html"&gt;EvenBetterAuthorizationSample&lt;/a&gt;, which is up to date (as of OS X 10.11, anyway) and actually does something you can test and copy. Especially study the README file, which provides more information about &lt;code&gt;SMJobBless()&lt;/code&gt; than any other Apple document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2012-241/"&gt;WWDC 2012 Session 241 "Cocoa Interprocess Communication with XPC"&lt;/a&gt; video if you are unfamiliar with XPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is what I wish somebody could have told me before I started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you will need to do is create a "helper tool" application to perform the privileged operations. This will be a command-line app that creates an XPC listener and handles requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The helper app has to have an info.plist and a launchd plist with some magical keys (see the EvenBetterAuthorizationSample for details)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The helper app will be embedded in the main app's package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main app will use the &lt;code&gt;AuthorizationCreate()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SMJobBless()&lt;/code&gt; functions to authenticate the user and install the helper tool as a privileged launchd service. (This is the point where the system will display a dialog asking the user for an admin username and password.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the helper tool is installed, use &lt;code&gt;-[NSXPCConnection initWithMachServiceName:options:]&lt;/code&gt; to connect to the helper tool. This will launch the helper tool on demand, running with root privileges.&lt;/li&gt;

I've used "&lt;a href="http://classic.tiddlywiki.com"&gt;classic TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt;" before, and liked its simplicity, but I was always a little annoyed with the weird steps you have to go through to save changes. The new version of TiddlyWiki ("TiddlyWiki5") includes support for running it as an HTTP server, so you can use it just like an online wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it took me a couple of hours to figure out how to set that up. The TiddlyWiki documentation is not clear ("not clear" is a euphemistic way of saying "terrible"). So I've written up these instructions in the hope it will spare somebody else all the frustration I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following instructions assume you are using a Mac running OS X, and that you know how to use the Terminal to run commands and how to create and edit text files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you're using Linux or BSD, you can probably figure out what you need to do differently. If you're running Windows, you have my sympathy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is not required to run TiddlyWiki, but I use it so that my personal notes will be available on all my machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't already have Dropbox, go to &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Node&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TiddlyWiki server requires &lt;a href="nodejs.org"&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;, so you will need to install that if you don't already have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are already using &lt;a href="http://brew.sh"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, then installation is as easy as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;brew install node
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you aren't using Homebrew, then go to &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org"&gt;https://nodejs.org&lt;/a&gt; and click the &lt;em&gt;Install&lt;/em&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time Machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first rule of using TiddlyWiki is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/static/The%2520First%2520Rule%2520of%2520Using%2520TiddlyWiki.html"&gt;back up your data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Using Dropbox serves as a rudimentary backup system, but it's not a real backup system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already set up Time Machine on your Mac, then go do it &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. See &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250"&gt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing TiddlyWiki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TiddlyWiki server is available as an &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiddlywiki"&gt;NPM module&lt;/a&gt;, so once you have Node installed, all you have to do is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;npm install -g tiddlywiki
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can do this to verify it is installed and usable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;tiddlywiki --help
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Initializing Your Wiki Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need to decide where to store your TiddlyWiki data. As I'm using Dropbox, I'll store everything in &lt;code&gt;/Users/kdj/Dropbox/tw&lt;/code&gt;, but you can use whatever directory makes sense for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run this command to initialize the directory for a TiddlyWiki server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;tiddlywiki /Users/kdj/Dropbox/tw --init server
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note: you can run &lt;code&gt;tiddlywiki --editions&lt;/code&gt; to see if any edition other than &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; might serve as a better starting point for you. I know that &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running the above command, you should see that the specified directory contains a &lt;code&gt;tiddlywiki.info&lt;/code&gt; file. This is the configuration file that controls how the server works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enabling the Markdown Plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiddlyWiki's &lt;a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/plugins/tiddlywiki/markdown/"&gt;Markdown plugin&lt;/a&gt; is included with the distribution, but is not enabled by default. To enable it, you have to edit your &lt;code&gt;tiddlywiki.info&lt;/code&gt; file and add &lt;code&gt;"tiddlywiki/markdown"&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; section. When you have finished editing, the file should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;{
    &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Basic client-server edition&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;plugins&amp;quot;: [
        &amp;quot;tiddlywiki/tiddlyweb&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;tiddlywiki/filesystem&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;tiddlywiki/codemirror&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;tiddlywiki/highlight&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;tiddlywiki/markdown&amp;quot;
    ],
    &amp;quot;themes&amp;quot;: [
        &amp;quot;tiddlywiki/vanilla&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;tiddlywiki/snowwhite&amp;quot;
    ]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Running the Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything set up, you can do this to run the server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;tiddlywiki /Users/kdj/Dropbox/tw --server 19671
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And then view it in a web browser: &lt;a href="http://localhost:19671"&gt;http://localhost:19671&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;tiddlywiki --help server&lt;/code&gt; to see what other options are available. You may want to use a different port, set a username/password, or otherwise customize the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting the Server Automatically When You Log In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would get annoying to have to type "&lt;code&gt;tiddlywiki /Users/kdj/Dropbox/tw --server 19671&lt;/code&gt;" every time you wanted to use your personal wiki. Let's create a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/launchd.plist"&gt;launchd configuration file&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;~/Library/LaunchAgents&lt;/code&gt; directory that will cause it to be automatically started every time we log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your  &lt;code&gt;~/Library/LaunchAgents&lt;/code&gt; directory and create a file named &lt;code&gt;com.tiddlywiki.plist&lt;/code&gt; with the following contents, substituting the appropriate path for your data directory and the paths to the &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tiddlywiki&lt;/code&gt; executables. (Run &lt;code&gt;which node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;which tiddlywiki&lt;/code&gt; if you don't know what those paths are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &amp;quot;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&amp;quot; &amp;quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;plist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Label&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.tiddlywiki&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/bin/node&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/bin/tiddlywiki&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/Users/kdj/Dropbox/tw&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;--server&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;19671&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;EnvironmentVariables&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;PATH&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;true/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/Users/kdj/Dropbox/tw&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;error.log&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;StandardOutputPath&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;output.log&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/plist&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After saving that file, log out and then log back in, and try to visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:19671"&gt;http://localhost:19671&lt;/a&gt;. If it works, great! If not, look for an &lt;code&gt;error.log&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;output.log&lt;/code&gt; file in your data directory that may explain what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restarting the Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, using Dropbox to sync TiddlyWiki data between machines does not work as expected.  The TiddlyWiki server does not monitor changes to the filesystem, so even though Dropbox will copy changed files between machines, each TiddlyWiki instance just keeps displaying whatever data it read when it was launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after saving changes on one machine, we have to restart the TiddlyWiki server on the other machines to have those changes displayed everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TiddlyWiki developers &lt;a href="http://tiddlywiki.narkive.com/npq5d9XI/tw-tiddlywiki-desktop-command-to-restart-node-instances"&gt;may eventually fix this&lt;/a&gt;, but in the meantime, we can define some shell commands to make it easy to restart the server when necessary.  Add these lines to your &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;export TWPLIST=~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tiddlywiki.plist
alias twstart=&amp;quot;launchctl load $TWPLIST&amp;quot;
alias twstop=&amp;quot;launchctl unload $TWPLIST&amp;quot;
alias twreload=&amp;quot;twstop &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sleep 1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; twstart &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo &amp;#39;TiddlyWiki restarted&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With these definitions, you can just execute &lt;code&gt;twreload&lt;/code&gt; and refresh your browser whenever you sit down at one of your computers, and that local TiddlyWiki will refresh itself from Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have everything working, explore the &lt;a href="http://tiddlywiki.com"&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt; website to learn more about how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you'll want to do is click the gear icon to go to the Control Panel and customize the site title and other settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tiddlywiki"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting Root on Huawei U8665 Fusion 2 Phone</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/getting-root-huawei-u8665-fusion-2-phone.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-20T00:33:07-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-20T00:33:07-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2015-02-20:/getting-root-huawei-u8665-fusion-2-phone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had an old &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2011/09/11/my-visit-android-land"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S Captivate&lt;/a&gt; phone, running Android 2.2, that I've used as a test device while developing Android apps. In my new job, I no longer need to support Android 2.2 (hooray!), but I do need to support Android 2.3 (boo!). I tried …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had an old &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2011/09/11/my-visit-android-land"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S Captivate&lt;/a&gt; phone, running Android 2.2, that I've used as a test device while developing Android apps. In my new job, I no longer need to support Android 2.2 (hooray!), but I do need to support Android 2.3 (boo!). I tried installing &lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org"&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt; to update the Captivate to Android 2.3, but I ended up bricking the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than spend more time trying to figure out how to fix that, I looked around for a cheap new Android 2.3 device, and found the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Android-Touchscreen-Bluetooth-Microsd/dp/B00BGYOO60"&gt;Huawei U8865&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the "Fusion 2", for $60. That seemed like a reasonable price for a brand-new old phone, so I purchased it and it arrived the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when I tried using it for development, I hit a snag. My work requires using &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;adb shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and related utilities, and whenever I tried those, I just got a "permission denied" response. I couldn't even take a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around for instructions to "root" the phone (that is, get privileged access). They aren't hard to find, but the people who write up these instructions all assume that (a) their readers have no idea what they are doing, and (b) everybody uses Windows. Neither of those are true for me, so I had to translate those instructions into developer-speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, if you are running Mac OS X and you already know how to use Terminal and &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt;, then here are instructions for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(These instructions are based on those at &lt;a href="http://androidforums.com/threads/step-by-step-root-walkthrough-for-huawei-fusion-2.685504/"&gt;http://androidforums.com/threads/step-by-step-root-walkthrough-for-huawei-fusion-2.685504/&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qtc37pley0vinj8/Huawei-Fusion-2-Recovery-Root.zip"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/qtc37pley0vinj8/Huawei-Fusion-2-Recovery-Root.zip&lt;/a&gt; and extract the contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Terminal and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the extracted &lt;code&gt;Huawei-Fusion-2-Recovery-Root/Huawei-Fusion-2-Recovery-Root&lt;/code&gt; directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reboot phone into fastboot by holding Volume Down and Power buttons simultaneously for 10-20 seconds. (It will freeze at the AT&amp;amp;T logo.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect phone to computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;fastboot devices&lt;/code&gt; to verify phone is connected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;fastboot flash recovery recovery.superrecovery.img&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After it finishes, unplug phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove back of phone, remove battery, wait 15 seconds, then re-insert battery and attach back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold Volume-Up and Power button simultaneously until it boots into recovery (15-20 seconds of holding both buttons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In recovery menu, select the "reboot device" option with the volume buttons (it should already start with reboot highlighted) and press the power button to reboot. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you will "have root". So if you use &lt;code&gt;adb shell&lt;/code&gt; to get a command shell on the device, you can run &lt;code&gt;su&lt;/code&gt; to get superuser privileges. There is also a new &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;SuperSU&lt;/a&gt; app on the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not really what I wanted. What I want to do is run &lt;code&gt;adb shell &amp;lt;some-command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; from the Mac. If you read the &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; documentation, you might think you can run &lt;code&gt;adb root&lt;/code&gt; to enable that, but you will just get an error message saying "adbd cannot run as root in production builds".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One needs to install an alternative version of &lt;code&gt;adbd&lt;/code&gt;. I downloaded and installed this one from Google Play: &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.adbd&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;adbd insecure&lt;/a&gt;. There is an option to have it automatically grant superuser access at boot, and I enabled that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="root"></category><category term="huawei"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Monochrome Color Themes for Xcode and Sublime Text</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/monochrome-color-themes-xcode-and-sublime-text.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-01T15:38:05-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-01T15:38:05-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2015-02-01:/monochrome-color-themes-xcode-and-sublime-text.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of programmers like brightly colored syntax-highlighting themes for their source code editors.

But even those feel too "busy" for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on a retrocomputing kick lately, and I've missed the clean look of source code on the monochrome monitors I used in the good old days. So I've created some monochrome Xcode themes. If you like them, you can download them from here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.github.io/MonochromeXcode/"&gt;http://kristopherjohnson.github.io/MonochromeXcode/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and copy them to your &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes&lt;/code&gt; directory, and then select them from the &lt;em&gt;Xcode &amp;rarr; Preferences &amp;rarr; Fonts &amp;amp; Colors&lt;/em&gt; window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These themes are also available as Sublime Text color schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.github.io/MonochromeSublimeText/"&gt;http://kristopherjohnson.github.io/MonochromeSublimeText/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were my simple rules for creating the themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All colors have the same hue. They differ only in saturation and brightness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments are dim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keywords are dim, but not as dim as comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numeric and string constants are bright, almost white.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other textual elements all have the same color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/"&gt;Source Code Pro Light&lt;/a&gt; as my font, as I like the way the thin lines give a vector-graphics look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Amber&lt;/h3&gt;

A few things have been unsettled, and I didn't want to write until I had some idea how they would turn out.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
We had been planning to buy the house we were living in, but that deal fell through in October, and we had only a couple of weeks to find a new home. (Lesson learned: Get &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in writing.) We are now renting a house in Suwanee, Georgia. We'll probably stay here until Bailey graduates from high school, then buy a house near the school where Pebble works. We were disappointed to lose that house, but it's probably for the best. There were many things wrong with it that we didn't notice until we'd been there a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still trying to sell our house in Dahlonega. Paying that mortgage and also paying rent has been a bit of a financial hardship, but moving back to Dahlonega isn't a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I haven't been working as much as I would like. My client's client went through a reorganization, and projects I was going to be working on have been held up as they were reviewed and replanned. This led to several weeks of me repeatedly asking when my next project would start, with the answer always being "any day now, we hope". It's been frustrating and a little scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected idle periods gave me time to reflect on my career path and what kinds of opportunities I should be pursuing. I've been working as an independent contractor, alone, for the past few years, and I realized that I missed being part of a team and having some ownership of the products that I worked on. So I decided I should consider giving up contract work and look for a permanent position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to find a great opportunity. On February 9, I start work as a Senior Software Engineer with &lt;a href="http://mobilelabsinc/"&gt;Mobile Labs&lt;/a&gt;. I'll be working on systems that let people remotely test mobile apps. I'll get to do development work on Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. A lot of the work involves reverse-engineering stuff and delving into operating system internals. I'll be working with a small team of experienced people, and I'll get to continue working from home. It seems like a great match for my experience and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family is doing well. The unexpected move at the end of October was stressful for everyone, but we've settled in to the new house. Bailey can now take the bus to school, and on the occasions when I do need to drive to his school, it is only a couple of miles away. The dogs love the fenced backyard. Pebble enjoys being closer to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey traveled to London over Christmas break with his high-school marching band, to participate in the &lt;a href="http://lnydp.com"&gt;London New Year's Day Parade&lt;/a&gt;. I think he enjoyed it, but it's hard to get any information out of a 15-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2014/03/24/2014-publix-georgia-marathon"&gt;ran my first marathon&lt;/a&gt; in March. Unfortunately, a few days afterward, I was hit with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis"&gt;plantar fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, which kept me from doing any running at all for a few months and is still pretty painful. I was hoping to run the marathon again this March, but I haven't been able to train for the past couple of months. Maybe I'll run the Savannah marathon in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My beard is gone. I shaved it off while doing the job-search thing. Haven't decided yet whether to re-grow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, things have been chaotic for the past few months, but I expect them to settle down. I'll have a steady paycheck and cool new stuff to work on and cool people to work with. We know where we'll be living for the next couple of years. Everybody is happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just noticed that this is the tenth &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/category/tags/birthday"&gt;birthday post&lt;/a&gt; I've written.

I had files in these locations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my main laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my old laptop (given to stepson for schoolwork), which still had all my files on it from the time before I got the new laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;family iMac, which in addition to having copies of my important files also had an external hard drive that held Time Machine backups for all home computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CrashPlan (offsite backup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox (which is not really a "backup", but it means it's easy to maintain multiple copies of important files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought I was pretty well backed up, until a few events happened in a short period of time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My main laptop's SSD filled up with work-related stuff, so I deleted some big non-work-related stuff (Aperture library, virtual machine images), because I knew I had copies of those things on my old laptop, our iMac, and in CrashPlan offsite backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My old laptop died when the kid dumped a glass of milk on it. So that's one old copy gone, but hey, we have others, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The external hard drive that held our Time Machine backups failed. So I bought a new external drive and reconfigured Time Machine on all our machines to back up to it. That meant we lost our old Time Machine backups, I didn't worry because I knew I had copies of important stuff on the family iMac, and we'd have fresh new Time Machine backups in no time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old family iMac died. We were lucky in that Apple botched the repair, and gave us a brand new machine to replace it, but the downside was that we lost everything that was on that machine's internal hard drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events all happened within a month. In hindsight, I wish I'd reacted faster, but at the time, I just thought, "It's OK, we still have other backups."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, we get this new iMac, and I figure I can just plug the external Time Machine drive into it and we'll have all our data back. But no: apparently I when I configured all the other family Macs to back themselves up to the family iMac's external drive, I neglected to configure the iMac to back &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to fall back to the CrashPlan backup. I am very glad we had it, because otherwise we would have lost our family photo archives and some other important stuff. But the downside is that it has taken about five days to restore everything from CrashPlan. I don't know whether to blame our ISP or CrashPlan for the slowness of the restoration, but being unable to use that new machine for five days has been annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CrashPlan's restoration functions suck. When I set up the CrashPlan app on the new iMac, it asked whether I would like to synchronize that new iMac with the old iMac's backup. "Sure, that would be awesome" I thought, and I clicked Yes. Then it took &lt;em&gt;two days&lt;/em&gt; for the synchronization to complete, and during that time I couldn't restore anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when synchronization finally completed, I checked the box to restore the entire hard drive and clicked the &lt;em&gt;Restore&lt;/em&gt; button. CrashPlan spent a couple of hours counting up how many files that was and how big they were, and then it crashed. I tried again, waited a couple of hours again, and it crashed again. (So you need to have a plan for when CrashPlan crashes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it apparently couldn't restore the entire hard drive at once, I selectively restored individual folders (&lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/Users/kdj&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/Users/pebble&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). This worked, but again I had to sit at the computer for a long time while CrashPlan counted up all the files, because after selecting something, you can't click &lt;em&gt;Restore&lt;/em&gt; until it finishes counting them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then after restoring, I noticed some files missing, so I had to go back into CrashPlan and play with the options to get it to restore files from the date our old iMac died, and to include deleted/hidden files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; machines are backing up to Time Machine. Check this every week or so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoring from CrashPlan sucks. Maybe that's just the nature of restoring a few hundred gigabytes of data over the Internet, but I may look into &lt;a href="https://www.backblaze.com"&gt;other options&lt;/a&gt; when my annual subscription expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When some link in the backup chain breaks, fix it right away.&lt;/li&gt;

Admittedly, I haven't paid much attention to &lt;em&gt;Dr. Dobb's&lt;/em&gt; for the past few years, but back when I was a kid who wanted to be a programmer, I anxiously awaited each monthly issue so that I could read every single article multiple times. We didn't have the Internet to give us whatever training we needed whenever we wanted, so magazines like &lt;em&gt;Dr. Dobb's&lt;/em&gt; were precious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reminiscing about &lt;em&gt;Dr. Dobb's&lt;/em&gt; with other grieving Twitter users, somebody brought up the fact that the first issue was titled &lt;a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/sourcecode/dr-dobbs-journal-30/30000144"&gt;"Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp;amp; Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte"&lt;/a&gt;  (which I think is the coolest magazine title I've ever heard). It started as a xerographed newsletter to tell people about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny BASIC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a simplified &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC"&gt;BASIC programming language&lt;/a&gt; interpreter that could run in 2 or 3 kilobytes of memory. That was an important feature back when personal computers had only 4 kilobytes of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just completed an implementation of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/suwaneeforth"&gt;Forth programming language interpreter&lt;/a&gt; in Apple's new &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; programming language, I got the idea of implementing a Tiny BASIC interpreter in Swift. It didn't make any sense. I didn't want to write any programs in Tiny BASIC. I didn't think anybody else would want to write any programs in Tiny BASIC. There are more important things I could be doing with my free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, apparently, reimplementing 50-year-old programming languages in Swift is my thing now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did it. I call it "Finch", and if you want it, you can find it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/FinchBasic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useless as it may be, it was an interesting exercise. Most of the Tiny BASIC implementations you find are focused on the original goal: getting a full implementation to fit in a few kilobytes. That isn't an important goal anymore, but I liked the idea of implementing a very-simple programming language. I focused on these goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Swift's high-level abstraction features, rather than writing code that looks like C or assembly language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it easy for new Swift programmers to understand, so it could be useful as a beginner's example or in a tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it easy for people to hack on to add new features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I did alright. It's about a thousand lines of code (not counting blank lines and comments), which is smaller than a &lt;a href="http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/TinyBasic/TinyBasic.c"&gt;C-based Tiny BASIC implementation&lt;/a&gt; I found, and I don't think I did anything too complicated. I will have to wait and see if anyone else wants to hack on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BASIC was the first programming language I learned. I expressed an interest in programming after attending an IBM open house, and my father brought home a BASIC programming manual. I studied it intently, but there weren't any computers around, so it was a while before I could try out what I had learned. But eventually the Radio Shack at the local mall started selling the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80"&gt;TRS-80&lt;/a&gt;, and I could walk into that store and write my very first program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;10 PRINT &amp;quot;TRS-80 SUCKS! &amp;quot;;
20 GOTO 10
RUN
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heartily agree with the first paragraph of &lt;code&gt;jonesforth.S&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FORTH is one of those alien languages which most working programmers regard in the same way as Haskell, LISP, and so on.  Something so strange that they'd rather any thoughts of it just go away so they can get on with writing this paying code.  But that's wrong and if you care at all about programming then you should at least understand all these languages, even if you will never use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/Markingbird/blob/master/README.md"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to use it, and some of the details of how the C# code was translated to Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't claim much credit for this project. It is really just a line-by-line translation of &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/introducing-markdownsharp/"&gt;Jeff Atwood's C# code&lt;/a&gt; into Swift. The result is not very pretty, as the C# code is itself based upon translations of Perl and PHP code. I don't recommend this as an example of how to write Swift code, but it does seem to work, and so I hope it is valuable to somebody someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was useful to me in that it let me write a lot of Swift code without thinking too much about it. It helped me develop Swift-editing muscle memory, quick scanning and correction of Swift syntax issues, and interpretation of the Swift compiler's not-always-helpful error messages. I thought about giving up a few times, as manual translation of 1,800 lines of C# and regular expressions wasn't a great way to spend nights and weekends, but I just couldn't leave it partially finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the translation by just copying and pasting the C# code into Xcode, and then fixing whatever was wrong. This was a real workout for Xcode 6 beta 5, as the SourceKitService or Xcode itself would often crash or lock up when it encountered C# code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most annoying and fiddly part of the process was translating the C# regular-expression strings into Swift. It would be nice if Swift had a "raw" string literal like other languages do, but it doesn't, so I manually transformed each regular expression into a Swift/NSRegularExpression-compatible form. Sublime Text's multiple-selection feature was really helpful for this. I probably could have written some sort of a script to automate the translations, but actually looking at every line was valuable in finding edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discovered a few differences between .NET regular expressions and Cocoa regular expressions. For example, in .NET you can use &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt; (a single space between square brackets) to mean a single space, but &lt;code&gt;NSRegularExpression&lt;/code&gt; won't accept this, so I had to use &lt;code&gt;\\p{Z}&lt;/code&gt; instead. Also, if a regular expression pattern ends with a &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; character, .NET apparently ignores it, but &lt;code&gt;NSRegularExpression&lt;/code&gt; just lets it match empty strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the messiest code that I wrote myself (rather than simply translating) is code that manipulates individual characters and substrings. Swift's &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type can make this difficult, due to its extensive Unicode support, so I found myself going back and forth between using &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NSString&lt;/code&gt; for string manipulation. The automatic bridging between those two types provided by Swift makes it pretty easy, but it would be nice if somebody made a library of utility functions for dealing with &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. (BTW, I strongly recommend that all Swift programmers read Ole Begemann's &lt;a href="http://oleb.net/blog/2014/07/swift-strings/"&gt;Strings in Swift&lt;/a&gt; article to find out what's going on with &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, the &lt;code&gt;SimpleTests&lt;/code&gt; test suite from MarkdownSharp works. I plan to port the remaining unit tests from MarkdownSharp, and add a few tests of my own. There are also a few TODOs left in the code that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make no promises about the robustness or performance of Markingbird. If you find problems, please submit issues and pull requests via GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some people will want to tell me that using regular expressions for this is bad, and this should be a real parser written in pure Swift. I agree completely: let me know when you have implemented that, and I'll post links to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="swift"></category><category term="markingbird"></category><category term="markdown"></category><category term="iosdev"></category></entry><entry><title>F#'s Pipe-Forward Operator in Swift</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/fs-pipe-forward-operator-swift.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-14T01:09:09-04:00</published><updated>2014-07-14T01:09:09-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2014-07-14:/fs-pipe-forward-operator-swift.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: At WWDC 2015, Apple announced Swift 2, which includes changes and a new feature called "protocol extensions" that render much of the code below either irrelevant or incorrect.

&lt;p&gt;Apple's new &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; programming language isn't really a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"&gt;functional programming language&lt;/a&gt;. However, it does support generic types and functional-programming patterns, so many FP aficionados are implementing their favorite functional idioms and libraries from other programming languages in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been a functional-programming enthusiast for a couple of decades, and I'm playing with this myself. A feature I like in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)"&gt;F# programming language&lt;/a&gt; is its &lt;a href="http://www.kevinberridge.com/2012/12/neat-f-pipe-forward.html"&gt;pipe-forward operator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which helps to write readable functional code. This article explains what that operator is, why you would want to use it, and how to do it in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: The code in this article is based upon the versions of the Swift language in Xcode 6.3. Future changes to Swift syntax or its standard library may render all of this incorrect or obsolete.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life without pipe-forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before describing pipe-forward, let's look at an example that demonstrates why we might want it. Say we need to write code that takes an array of integers, filters out the odd numbers, sorts the remaining even numbers in descending order, and then renders the result as a string of comma-separated numbers. Using methods of Swift's &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/SwiftStandardLibraryReference/Array.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014608-CH5-SW1"&gt;Array&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/SwiftStandardLibraryReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014608-CH7-SW1"&gt;String&lt;/a&gt; classes, we could do it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;let numbers = [67, 83, 4, 99, 22, 18, 21, 24, 23, 2, 86]

let result = &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.join(numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
                              .sorted { $1 &amp;lt; $0 }
                              .map { $0.description })
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The value of &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; is the string &lt;code&gt;"86, 24, 22, 18, 4, 2"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; expression might be a little complicated, but at a glance it is easy to see that it filters the numbers,  sorts them, maps the values to strings, and then uses &lt;code&gt;String.join()&lt;/code&gt; to construct the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren't familiar with using &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; to transform collections, read &lt;a href="http://robnapier.net/maps"&gt;the Cocoaphony article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what if, instead of an &lt;em&gt;array&lt;/em&gt; of numbers, we have a &lt;em&gt;sequence&lt;/em&gt; of numbers? A sequence doesn't have methods like &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; does. Instead we will have to use the &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sorted()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; free functions provided by the Swift standard library. If we try to write the code as a single expression like we did above, we end up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;let seq = SequenceOf(numbers)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="x"&gt;let seqResult =&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.join(map(sorted(filter(seq)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;escription&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;let seqResultMultiLine =
    &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.join(
        map(
            sorted(
                filter(seq) { $0 % 2 == 0 }
            ) { $1 &amp;lt; $0 }
        ) { $0.description })
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's not very readable, is it? We can see at a glance that &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sorted&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; are being used, but we have to read it inside-out and backwards to follow the order of evaluation and figure out which closure goes with which function call and how the data is flowing through those functions. We probably wouldn't even try to write it as a single expression, and would instead write it as a sequence of intermediate results to make it understandable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;let filteredNumbers = filter(seq) { $0 % 2 == 0 }
let sortedNumbers = sorted(filteredNumbers) { $1 &amp;lt; $0 }
let numbersAsStrings = map(sortedNumbers) { (n: Int) -&amp;gt; String in n.description }
let commaSeparatedResult = &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.join(numbersAsStrings)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's easier to understand, but it's noisier than the original &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;-based code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life with pipe-forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be nice if we could call a function on a value using a postfix notation like we call a method on an object? That is, wouldn't it be nice if we could write something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;let pipeResult =
    seq |&amp;gt; filteredWithPredicate { $0 % 2 == 0 }
        |&amp;gt; sortedByPredicate { $1 &amp;lt; $0 }
        |&amp;gt; mappedWithTransform { $0.description }
        |&amp;gt; String.join(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can. That &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator is called the "pipe-forward" or "forward pipe" operator in F#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;x |&amp;gt; f
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;is equivalent to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;f(x)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;x |&amp;gt; f |&amp;gt; g |&amp;gt; h
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;is equivalent to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;h(g(f(x)))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's just syntactic sugar, but it is often clearer to express a sequence of function calls as a chain read left-to-right/top-to-bottom than as a cluster of nested subexpressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be defined as an operator in Swift like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;infix operator |&amp;gt;   { precedence 50 associativity left }

public func |&amp;gt; &amp;lt;T,U&amp;gt;(lhs: T, rhs: T -&amp;gt; U) -&amp;gt; U {
    return rhs(lhs)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have some work to do before we can evaluate &lt;code&gt;pipeResult&lt;/code&gt; above with our &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator. The problem is that the &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sorted()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; functions provided by the Swift standard library don't have their parameters in the order we need, and they are not written to support &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application"&gt;partial application&lt;/a&gt;.  For example, let's look at the first subexpression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;seq |&amp;gt; filteredWithPredicate { $0 % 2 == 0 }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The pipe-forward operator transforms it to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;filteredWithPredicate({ $0 % 2 == 0 })(seq)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So we need &lt;code&gt;filteredWithPredicate&lt;/code&gt; to be a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH34-XID_591"&gt;curried function&lt;/a&gt; that takes the predicate as the first argument and sequence as second argument. Unfortunately, the library's &lt;code&gt;fillter/sorted/map&lt;/code&gt; functions are not curried and are called with the sequence as the first argument and function as second argument.  To make the &lt;code&gt;pipeResult&lt;/code&gt; expression compile and run, we need to provide some "adapter functions" that have the necessary signatures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;// Curried adapter function for Swift Standard Library&amp;#39;s filter() function
public func filteredWithPredicate&amp;lt;S : SequenceType&amp;gt;
    (includeElement: (S.Generator.Element) -&amp;gt; Bool)
    (source: S)
    -&amp;gt; [S.Generator.Element]
{
    return filter(source, includeElement)
}

// Curried adapter function for Swift Standard Library&amp;#39;s sorted() function
public func sortedByPredicate&amp;lt;S : SequenceType&amp;gt;
    (predicate: (S.Generator.Element, S.Generator.Element) -&amp;gt; Bool)
    (source: S)
    -&amp;gt; [S.Generator.Element]
{
    return sorted(source, predicate)
}

// Curried adapter function for Swift Standard Library&amp;#39;s map() function
public func mappedWithTransform&amp;lt;S: SequenceType, T&amp;gt;
    (transform: (S.Generator.Element) -&amp;gt; T)
    (source: S)
    -&amp;gt; [T]
{
    return map(source, transform)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These adapter declarations may look complicated, but all we did was copy the signatures of the original functions, then curry the parameters and reverse their order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we don't need to write an adapter function to use the &lt;code&gt;String.join()&lt;/code&gt; method, because instance methods of structs and classes can be used as curried functions. See &lt;a href="http://oleb.net/blog/2014/07/swift-instance-methods-curried-functions/"&gt;Ole Begemann's article&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those adapter function declarations, the &lt;code&gt;pipeResult&lt;/code&gt; expression works as expected. Complete code that can be pasted into a Swift playground is available here: &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/ed97acf0bbe0013df8af"&gt;https://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/ed97acf0bbe0013df8af&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem like we have done a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of work just to have a pretty-looking filter-sort-map-reduce expression, but thanks to generic types, all of the above can be reused wherever we need it.  All our data-processing code can look like simple transformation pipelines, and that's worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft's Visual Studio, if you are writing F# code and you type &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the IDE pops up an auto-completion list of all the functions that can be applied to the value on the left, just like typing a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; after an object brings up a list of its methods and properties. Xcode can do this too, but without &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; being a standard Swift operator, few developers will be able to take advantage of it. If you think &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and functional auto-complete would be a useful addition to Swift and Xcode, you can submit a bug report to Apple requesting it. (You can &lt;a href="http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5837161337192448"&gt;dupe my radar&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optional chaining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we have functions that return Optionals, and want to pipe those to functions that take non-Optional values? We can define a couple of operators to handle those cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;infix operator |&amp;gt;!  { precedence 50 associativity left }
infix operator |&amp;gt;&amp;amp;  { precedence 50 associativity left }

public func |&amp;gt;! &amp;lt;T,U&amp;gt;(lhs: T?, rhs: T -&amp;gt; U) -&amp;gt; U {
    return rhs(lhs!)
}

public func |&amp;gt;&amp;amp; &amp;lt;T,U&amp;gt;(lhs: T?, rhs: T -&amp;gt; U) -&amp;gt; U? {
    return lhs.map(rhs)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;!&lt;/code&gt; operator unwraps its left-side argument and passes it to the function on the right. This is safe if we know that the Optional value will never be nil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator checks whether the left-side argument is &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;. If so, the value of the expression is &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;. If not, then the Optional is unwrapped and the right-side function is applied to it. (I'd rather name this operator &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, but Swift doesn't allow the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; character in operator names.)  This is the same as just calling &lt;code&gt;Optional.map()&lt;/code&gt;, but if we are using a pipeline it is useful to use just pipe operators rather than mixing pipes and method calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some simple usage examples, using the Swift Standard Library's &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; function, which returns an &lt;code&gt;Int?&lt;/code&gt; which is the index of the searched-for value, or &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; if not found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;let elements = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

func reportIndexOfValue(value: Int)(index: Int) -&amp;gt; String {
    let message = &amp;quot;Found \(value) at index \(index)&amp;quot;
    println(message)
    return message
}

find(elements, 6) |&amp;gt;! reportIndexOfValue(6)    // &amp;quot;Found 6 at index 2&amp;quot;

find(elements, 3) |&amp;gt;&amp;amp; reportIndexOfValue(3)    // nil
find(elements, 4) |&amp;gt;&amp;amp; reportIndexOfValue(4)    // {Some &amp;quot;Found 4 at index 1&amp;quot;}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Functions with multiple parameters, and tuples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem that the pipe-forward operator is only useful when passing an argument to a function that takes a single parameter. However, a Swift function can be applied to a tuple of arguments, so you can use a tuple on the left side of &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a function taking multiple arguments on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(x, y, z) |&amp;gt; f
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;is equivalent to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;f(x, y, z)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Foundation&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diagonalLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diagonalLength&lt;/span&gt;                     &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;5.0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;multiplyAndDivide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;multiplier1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;multiplier2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;divisor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;multiplier1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;multiplier2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;divisor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;multiplyAndDivide&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These can be useful in more complex pipeline expressions that require use of tuples as arguments, results, or intermediate values. We can use &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/04dbc470e17f67f836a2"&gt;zip() or zip3()&lt;/a&gt; to combine values from other sequences into tuples to be piped into functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could even do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;let evenNumbers = (seq, { $0 % 2 == 0 }) |&amp;gt; filter
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That seems unnecessarily weird in isolation, but it may be useful in the context of a larger pipe expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Fowler's &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/"&gt;Collection Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; article is a good overview of the general pattern, with examples in multiple programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Afterword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above was originally written with an early beta of Swift. As of Xcode 6 beta 4, the Swift standard library provides a &lt;code&gt;lazy()&lt;/code&gt; function that transforms a sequence into an object that has lazily evaluated &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; methods, so we could solve the problem like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;let lazyResult =&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.join(lazy(seq).filter(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;).array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;                       .sorted(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;                       .map &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;escription&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I still prefer the &lt;code&gt;pipeResult&lt;/code&gt; expression. I think it looks more like a data-flow illustration. The lazy version has some excess noise (&lt;code&gt;lazy()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.array&lt;/code&gt;), and it may be even more mystifying to non-functional programmers than the pipeline notation is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pipeAdapted"&gt;Another afterword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above, after the definitions of the "adapter functions", I wrote "all we did was copy the signatures of the original functions, then curry the parameters and reverse their order." That seems like something we should be able to do with a higher-level function, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;// Given a function with signature (A, B) -&amp;gt; T, return curried
// function with signature (B)(A) -&amp;gt; T
func pipeAdapted&amp;lt;A, B, T&amp;gt;(f: (A, B) -&amp;gt; T) -&amp;gt; (B -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; T) {
    return { b in { a in f(a, b) } }
}

let pipeAdaptedResult =
    seq |&amp;gt; pipeAdapted(filter)({ $0 % 2 == 0 })
        |&amp;gt; pipeAdapted(sorted)({ $1 &amp;lt; $0 })
        |&amp;gt; pipeAdapted(map)({ $0.description })
        |&amp;gt; String.join(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here, we use a &lt;code&gt;pipeAdapted()&lt;/code&gt; function to transform the standard library's &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sorted&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; functions into what we need, instead of writing those adapters. If you and your team members are all FP ninjas who don't bat an eye at throwing functions around, then you may prefer this, but my preference is still for the version that uses the adapter functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative that may be a little more palatable to non-FP people is to define another pipe operator that lets us specify a function and predicate, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;infix operator |&amp;gt;*  { precedence 50 associativity left }

// Transform &amp;quot;x |&amp;gt;* (f, predicate)&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;f(x, predicate)&amp;quot;
public func |&amp;gt;* &amp;lt;A, B, C, T&amp;gt;(lhs: A, rhs: ((A, (B) -&amp;gt; C) -&amp;gt; T, (B) -&amp;gt; C)) -&amp;gt; T {
    return (rhs.0)(lhs, rhs.1)
}

let pipeStarResult =
    seq |&amp;gt;* (filter, { $0 % 2 == 0 })
        |&amp;gt;* (sorted, { $1 &amp;lt; $0 })
        |&amp;gt;* (map, { $0.description })
        |&amp;gt; String.join(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that a big problem with either of these approaches is that the Swift compiler takes a very, very, VERY long time to compile them, presumably due to a combinatorial explosion in the type-inferencing mechanism with all those generic types. This may be a temporary issue that will be resolved as the Swift compiler matures, but for now, it's hard to recommend these approaches for general-purpose use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can hope that a future version of Swift will provide better built-in support for curried functions and partial application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one could skip all this "currying" and "adapter" business and use some closures to define ad-hoc anonymous functions that can be applied to sequences in a pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;let closuresResult =
    seq |&amp;gt; { s in filter(s) { $0 % 2 == 0 } }
        |&amp;gt; { s in sorted(s) { $1 &amp;lt; $0 } }
        |&amp;gt; { s in map(s) { $0.description } }
        |&amp;gt; String.join(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I still find something like this hard to read, but with more FP-in-Swift experience, it may be as clear as &lt;code&gt;pipeResult&lt;/code&gt;. And thankfully, it compiles quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="swift"></category><category term="iosdev"></category><category term="functionalprogramming"></category><category term="fsharp"></category></entry><entry><title>KJTipCalculator: A Simple iOS Swift App</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/kjtipcalculator-simple-ios-swift-app.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-21T15:16:43-04:00</published><updated>2014-06-21T15:16:43-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2014-06-21:/kjtipcalculator-simple-ios-swift-app.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to using Swift, the app also uses an embedded framework, which is a new feature of iOS&amp;nbsp;8. The framework contains functions and classes for converting between numbers and text, and it might be useful in other apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version is a little nicer than the original in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can type or paste text into the top box and the formatted JSON immediately appears in the lower box. There is no longer a need to press a &lt;strong&gt;Format&lt;/strong&gt; button because Angular's data-binding mechanism takes care of automatically updating the output whenever the input changes. (This is possible with jQuery too, but takes more work.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can control the indentation width of the formatted JSON.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the input is not valid JSON, the output panel changes its background color to red when displaying the error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is: &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/undefinedvalue/ng-formatjson.html"&gt;JSON Formatter with AngularJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If don't know anything about AngularJS, but are curious about it, look at the source and note the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The magic of Angular comes from the &lt;code&gt;ng-&lt;/code&gt; attributes attached to HTML elements. There is no need for a separate template language or explicit DOM manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp"&gt;ng-app&lt;/a&gt; attribute attached to the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element sets up the &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module"&gt;module&lt;/a&gt; that contains our app's code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngController"&gt;ng-controller&lt;/a&gt; attribute attached to the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element defines which controller function to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel"&gt;ng-model&lt;/a&gt; attribute attached to the first &lt;code&gt;textarea&lt;/code&gt; element binds its content to the &lt;code&gt;inputText&lt;/code&gt; variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngBind"&gt;ng-bind&lt;/a&gt; attribute attached to the second &lt;code&gt;textarea&lt;/code&gt; element binds its content to the value of the &lt;code&gt;outputText&lt;/code&gt; variable, and the &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClass"&gt;ng-class&lt;/a&gt; attribute binds its CSS class to the value of the &lt;code&gt;outputClass&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/select"&gt;ng-options&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel"&gt;ng-model&lt;/a&gt; directives on the &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; element bind it to the &lt;code&gt;indentOptions&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;selectedIndentOption&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the controller code, we set initial values for the &lt;code&gt;inputText&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;indentOptions&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;selectedInputOption&lt;/code&gt; variables, and then use &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope"&gt;$scope.$watch()&lt;/a&gt; to update the values of &lt;code&gt;outputText&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;outputClass&lt;/code&gt; whenever any of the inputs change.&lt;/li&gt;

Unfortunately, having OS X Server installed complicates the use of the built-in local Apache web server which I use for web development. I've figured out how to make things work the way I like, and I have written this article so that I can find the information again when I need it. Maybe it will help somebody else too.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enabling Local Websites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to enable the web server, open the OS X Server app, select &lt;strong&gt;Websites&lt;/strong&gt; in the sidebar,  and flip the switch to &lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt;. You should be able to visit &lt;a href="http://localhost/"&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/a&gt; in a web browser and see a page titled "Welcome to OS X Server".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are on the Websites configuration screen, you may want to enable PHP and Python web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the Xcode service enabled, then instead of "Welcome to OS X Server" you may see the Xcode Bots page. This may be OK with you, but if you would rather not see the Xcode stuff in place of the default website, then in the Server app, go to the &lt;strong&gt;Websites&lt;/strong&gt; screen, double-click &lt;strong&gt;Server Website&lt;/strong&gt; to edit it, click the &lt;strong&gt;Edit...&lt;/strong&gt; button next to &lt;strong&gt;Index Files&lt;/strong&gt;, and remove the &lt;code&gt;/xcode&lt;/code&gt; entry. Now, visiting &lt;a href="http://localhost/"&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/a&gt; should take you to the "Welcome to OS X Server" screen, and you can visit &lt;a href="http://localhost/xcode"&gt;http://localhost/xcode&lt;/a&gt; to see Xcode Bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Website Directories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to know where you can put your website files so that they will be served by the server. By default, the server will look for files in &lt;code&gt;/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default&lt;/code&gt;. You could put your files in that directory, but I prefer to use symlinks so that I can keep all my files in my home directory. So, for example, if your main website file is &lt;code&gt;/Users/kdj/work/mywebapp/index.html&lt;/code&gt;, you can symlink it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ln -s /Users/kdj/work/mywebapp /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default/mywebapp
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then if you visit &lt;code&gt;http://localhost/mywebapp&lt;/code&gt;, you should see your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Per-user Website Directories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, instead of making modifications to the &lt;code&gt;/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites&lt;/code&gt; directory, you might want to set up per-user websites as are available on OS X when Server is not installed and "Web Sharing" is enabled. To do this, you have to edit the &lt;code&gt;https_server_app.conf&lt;/code&gt; configuration file. This file is only writable by root by default, so you will need to use &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;. So, for example, if you use &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;, then do this to edit the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo vi /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/httpd_server_app.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You need to uncomment two lines. First, uncomment the line for &lt;code&gt;apple_userdir_module&lt;/code&gt; to enable it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;#Server-specific modules
# SERVER_INSTALL_PATH_PREFIX should be set as Environment variable in launchd.plist
LoadModule apple_userdir_module &lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SERVER_INSTALL_PATH_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/usr/libexec/apache2/mod_userdir_apple.so
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then uncomment the line that includes the user configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# User home directories
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, after stopping and restarting the Websites service, you should be able to access directories under your &lt;code&gt;~/Sites&lt;/code&gt; directory. For example, if your user account name is &lt;code&gt;kdj&lt;/code&gt;, and you have a website at &lt;code&gt;/Users/kdj/Sites/mywebapp/index.html&lt;/code&gt;, then you should be able to visit &lt;a href="http://localhost/~kdj/mywebapp"&gt;http://localhost/~kdj/mywebapp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MAMP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished a freaking marathon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran the &lt;a href="http://www.usroadsports.com/Signature/Georgia/"&gt;2014 Publix Georgia Marathon&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta on March 23. I got up at 4:00 AM, drove to the &lt;a href="http://www.itsmarta.com"&gt;MARTA&lt;/a&gt; train station, and took the train to Centennial Park, where the race started and finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished a freaking marathon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran the &lt;a href="http://www.usroadsports.com/Signature/Georgia/"&gt;2014 Publix Georgia Marathon&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta on March 23. I got up at 4:00 AM, drove to the &lt;a href="http://www.itsmarta.com"&gt;MARTA&lt;/a&gt; train station, and took the train to Centennial Park, where the race started and finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was good for running a marathon. Temperatures were in the 50's, and the sky was covered with clouds. The forecast called for rain, but aside from a few sprinkles halfway through the race, we stayed dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have previously run two half marathons with times around 2:10, so I was expecting my marathon time to be somewhere between four-and-a-half and five hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was wildly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Marathon &lt;a href="http://www.usroadsports.com/Signature/Georgia/PDF/2014_PGM_CourseMap.pdf"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; is very hilly. The course I run when training has more hills than the average marathon course, I think, but it didn’t prepare me for this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first ten miles, I kept to my goal pace of ten and a half minutes per mile. After mile 12, I had to walk up most of the uphill stretches, and there were a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of uphill stretches. After mile 21, I couldn’t even run on the downhill stretches anymore. My legs would cramp whenever I tried to run. I wasn’t even sure I’d be able to walk those last five miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final time was 5:41, about an hour longer than I expected. I think I did everything right in terms of preparation, nutrition, hydration, and pacing. I just hadn’t built up the endurance to run 26 miles of hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, I finished a freaking marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My FitBit says I took over 54,000 steps (including steps walking to/from the marathon). I suspect that will be my daily step record for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mile 20, some spectators were handing out cups with a brownish liquid. I assumed it was iced tea, but was delighted to find that it was cold beer. I’d like to nominate those people for the Presidential Medal of Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

Esri provides an easy-to-use installer and &lt;a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/info/install.htm"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; for setting up the SDK so that it can be used with Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installer puts the SDK files in the user’s home directory, and the setup guide recommends using paths like &lt;code&gt;$(HOME)/Library/SDKs/ArcGIS/iOS/&lt;/code&gt; in Xcode projects to find the framework’s headers and libraries. This works fine as long as one is using Xcode as a user who has installed the SDK. However, it causes problems if one wants to set up an &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/xcode_guide-continuous_integration/ConfigureBots/ConfigureBots.html"&gt;Xcode bot&lt;/a&gt; to automatically build and test the app. The Xcode service that runs bots executes under the &lt;code&gt;_teamsserver&lt;/code&gt; user account, and by default that user’s home directory does not exist, and you can’t log in as that user to run the SDK installer. So attempts to create a bot to build the app just result in “ArcGIS.h not found” compilation errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I bit of Googling and experimentation, I came up with a solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the SDK in my user account (or another normal account), following Esri’s installer and instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make my &lt;code&gt;~/Library&lt;/code&gt; directory world-readable:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;chmod 755 ~/Library&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;/var/teamsserver&lt;/code&gt; home directory for the &lt;code&gt;_teamsserver&lt;/code&gt; user:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /var/teamsserver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;/var/teamsserver/Library&lt;/code&gt; directory for the &lt;code&gt;_teamsserver&lt;/code&gt; user:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /var/teamsserver/Library&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;_teamsserver&lt;/code&gt; as the owner of the directories:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo chown -R _teamsserver:_teamsserver /var/teamsserver/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set permissions on the directories:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo chmod -R 770 /var/teamsserver/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a symbolic link to the SDK installation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo ln -s ~/Library/SDKs /var/teamsserver/Library/SDKs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works. It could be argued that it would be better to set up the symbolic links in some shared location (&lt;code&gt;/Library&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and then use a full path in the Xcode project to find them, but I prefer this solution because it doesn’t require any extra steps for developers who don’t need to set up a bot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="xcode"></category><category term="iosdev"></category><category term="bot"></category><category term="arcgis"></category></entry><entry><title>47</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/47.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-19T19:17:58-05:00</published><updated>2014-01-19T19:17:58-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2014-01-19:/47.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another annual State of the Kris message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest change for my family this year was moving from our little mountain cabin in Dahlonega to a house in Cumming. This puts us closer to the schools where Pebble teaches and where Bailey learns. Instead of spending two hours commuting per day, we now spend about 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to joke that we should just move to exit 14, since that’s where we spent our weekends shopping. Now we’re here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our five dogs love the big fenced-in wooded backyard. They get to chase deer once in a while. (I don't know what a Yorkshire Terrier would do if it caught a deer, but I'm not worried about that happening.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran two half marathons this year, and I’m preparing to run a marathon in March. I’ll probably also try to run the Atlanta Marathon in October. After that, I suspect I will be finished with marathons, but will keep running twenty or thirty miles per week. I enjoy running, and like being in better shape than I have been for the past couple decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pebble is now working at North Forsyth High School, teaching courses in forensics and agricultural science. She seems less stressed-out than she did while working at the middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey is really enjoying the marching band. His band went to a competition in New York, and they took third place. The band will be going to London in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually make a list of goals for each year. However, I rarely consult that list after making it, so I’m not going to bother this year. I hope to run two marathons, and I hope to learn to play piano, but I really just want to enjoy life in our new home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="self-indulgence"></category><category term="birthday"></category></entry><entry><title>Garmin Forerunner 110 Blank Screen</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/garmin-forerunner-110-blank-screen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-14T15:16:47-05:00</published><updated>2014-01-14T15:16:47-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2014-01-14:/garmin-forerunner-110-blank-screen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-GPS-Enabled-Sport-Monitor/dp/B003JTLKIA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1389711829&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=garmin+forerunner+110+red"&gt;Garmin Forerunner 110&lt;/a&gt; GPS watch to track my runs.

I've been happy with it, but today when I plugged it into my computer after a run, the watch screen flashed "Saving activity" and then went blank. The watch was dead after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been fully charged before my run, so I was pretty sure it wasn't just out of juice. The instructions provided with the watch weren't helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blank-screen issue appears to be a common problem. The &lt;a href="https://forums.garmin.com/showthread.php?10639-Forerunner-110-Blank-Screen-(Dead)"&gt;Forerunner 110 Blank Screen (Dead)&lt;/a&gt; thread in the Garmin forums has over 100 entries. You can browse that thread for details, but here is a summary of the suggested fixes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold down the Light, Start/Stop, and Lap/Reset buttons for about 30 seconds. (This worked for me.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold down all four buttons for about 7 seconds. (Didn't work for me.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold down the Light button for about 6 seconds. (Didn't work for me.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold down the "Power" button while plugging it into the computer. (My watch doesn't have a button labeled "Power". I tried this with the Light button, and with the Page/Menu button, but neither worked.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plug it into a different USB port. (Didn't work for me.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just leave it plugged in for a few days, and eventually it will spring back to life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rub the contacts with a pencil eraser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach the USB clip, but don't attach the clip to a USB port, and hold the Light button for 6 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check whether there is a &lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/firmware"&gt;firmware update&lt;/a&gt; available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try a &lt;a href="http://support.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId=%7B0439fb90-a761-11e0-d01c-000000000000%7D"&gt;master reset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact Garmin Customer Support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the watch back to where you bought it for replacement/refund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got it working, i checked for a &lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/firmware"&gt;firmware update&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed there was a new firmware version available for the Forerunner 110. This is in the release notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes from version 2.60 to version 2.70:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where the device could display a blank screen while connected to the charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed the update. I'll have to wait to see whether the problem recurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2014-01-23:&lt;/strong&gt; The screen went blank again. Hold down the Light, Start/Stop, and Lap/Reset buttons got it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2014-03-09:&lt;/strong&gt; Blank again, and the above remedies weren't working. The recharging display did appear when I connect it to USB, but it wouldn't do anything when disconnected. I let it sit disconnected for a few hours, and it sprung to life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="troubleshooting"></category><category term="running"></category><category term="garmin"></category><category term="forerunner"></category></entry><entry><title>The Running Thing</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/running-thing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-01T20:38:04-05:00</published><updated>2014-01-01T20:38:04-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2014-01-01:/running-thing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I was proud of &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2013/01/01/couch-potato-running-10k-few-months"&gt;running a 10K&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I've learned along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a training plan is important. Just going out and running a few miles when you feel like it doesn't get you anywhere. You need to steadily build up your mileage. I can personally recommend the &lt;a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml"&gt;Couch-to-5K&lt;/a&gt; plan for beginners, and I am currently in week 7 of &lt;a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program"&gt;Hal Higdon's novice marathon training program&lt;/a&gt;, which is working well so far. Put your workouts on your calendar, and treat them like any other important appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest is important. All the training plans have rest days and "easy weeks" for good reasons. Don't push yourself too far too fast, or you will just hurt yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretching is important. I used to roll my eyes at the people who seemed to spend more time with their stretching rituals than actually running, but after trying it myself, I found it was easier to run and I was less sore afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoes are important. When my runs started getting into the five- and six-mile range, I was getting shin splints and other pains. Then I bought some new shoes, and those problems went away. My current favorite shoe is the Asics GEL-Cumulus 15, but you need to try on shoes yourself to find what works for you. I have two pairs of shoes, which I alternate (so that each pair gets 48 hours to dry out and re-spongify between uses), and I replace them after 200-300 miles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gadgets are fun. The geek in me likes having instrumentation. Using a &lt;a href="http://www.fitbit.com/"&gt;FitBit&lt;/a&gt; or a GPS-tracking device to record runs was helpful in sticking to my training plan, because even when I didn't feel like running, I wanted my numbers to be right. I used a couple of smartphone-based run-tracker apps early in my experience, but stopped using them when I got tired of carrying a phone-sized device when running (particularly an Android phone-sized device). I now have a Garmin Forerunner 110 watch that records my time, distance, and heart rate for each run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Races are fun. You may have to do all or most of your running by yourself, but entering a real race lets you share the experience with hundreds or thousands of other people. It's a festive atmosphere, and everyone is encouraging and supportive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, almost anyone can do this. I'm almost 47 years old, and have led a sedentary lifestyle for the last 30 years, but I will be running my first marathon in a few months. Obviously, if you have serious health problems or physical limitations, you might not be able to do it, but if you're reasonably healthy, it's just a matter of putting in the time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="running"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting Up Windows, My Way</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/setting-windows-my-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-22T19:25:36-05:00</published><updated>2013-12-22T19:25:36-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-12-22:/setting-windows-my-way.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a companion piece to my &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2013/08/30/setting-new-mac-my-way"&gt;Setting Up a New Mac, My Way&lt;/a&gt; entry.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use Windows much in the past couple of years, but when I do have to set up a Windows machine for some task that requires it, I want to have a list of things to do to minimize the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is a work in progress. It will evolve every time I go through the setup process, and every time I have to work around some annoying Windows limitation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install/reinstall Windows. (The remaining steps assume the version is Windows 8.1 Pro x64, and it is running in VMWare on a Mac.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Windows 8 start screen, remove everything except Desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Desktop, right-click the taskbar, choose Properties, select the Navigation tab, and check the &lt;em&gt;When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of Start&lt;/em&gt; box and the &lt;em&gt;Show the Apps view automatically when I go to Start&lt;/em&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Settings (or Control Panel or wherever Microsoft puts these things this year) make these changes:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the Location is &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;English (United States)&lt;/em&gt; is the preferred language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable automatic Windows updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the desktop background to a solid color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable these desktop icons:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recycle Bin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my answer to that question. Some time during my first few years of programming, I wrote code similar to this little snippet and expected it to print "FOO", but instead it prints "None of the above". It is written in C, but should be comprehensible to anyone who knows a language with similar syntax (C++, Java, JavaScript, C#, etc.). It took me about a half day of staring and single-stepping in a debugger to figure out what was wrong. When I looked at the disassembly listing, I was convinced I'd found a bug in the C compiler. Maybe you can figure it out faster than I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FOO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FOO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, with the releases of Android 4 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been an iPhone user for the past five years, except for a &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2011/09/11/my-visit-android-land"&gt;few weeks&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 when I used an Android phone to see how good it was. At that time, my evaluation was that Android was a second-rate knock-off of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, with the releases of Android 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich" and 4.1 "Jelly Bean", Android got a lot less ugly, and hardware is finally fast enough that it doesn't feel so slow. Because I make about half my income from Android app development, I decided it was time to give Android another try as my personal phone. I vowed to put the iPhone away, buy a top-of-the-line Android phone, and use it for at least 12 months. My goal was to immerse myself in the Android ecosystem and learn how "regular people" use their Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I made this purchase in July, the two top-tier Android phones were the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. I've hated the two Samsung devices I've owned (Samsung Galaxy S and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0), so it was an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't re-hash the things that all the other HTC One reviews say. These are my personal impressions, and what I do and don't like about the HTC One may not match your preferences.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's Too Big&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among iOS developers, the "huge Android phone" has been a running joke. Android OEMs have kept pushing the sizes of their screens to four inches, five inches, or more in a weird race, while Apple has stuck to its concept of a small thin device. I didn't want a big phone, but there are a lot of people who do, so I bought a big phone to get a better understanding of the trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would eventually get used to it, but four months later, it's still too big. It's hard to pull it out of my pocket, it's hard to reach the power button to turn it on, it's hard to reach all the places on the screen with my thumb. I find I have to use two hands to really use it, whereas my iPhone was usually a one-handed device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my most valuable Android apps is &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexnor.gravityscreenoffpro"&gt;Gravity Screen Pro&lt;/a&gt;. What it does is automatically turn the phone off when I put it in my pocket, and turn it back on when I take it out of my pocket. This is a big deal, because it is difficult to reach the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is nice to have that large screen, especially when browsing the web or reading. But I have a half-dozen other devices around the house that are even better for browsing the web or reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC recently introduced the &lt;a href="http://www.htc.com/www/smartphones/htc-one-mini/"&gt;HTC One mini&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a better size for me. Unfortunately, in addition to being a small phone, it is also a cheap phone, without the performance of the One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Phone's Camera is Terrible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the early reviews of the HTC One praised the low-light capabilities of its camera. So I was surprised when I tried to take some low-light pictures and they looked like everything was in a cloud of purple haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, &lt;a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/htc-one-camera-purple-tint-268232/"&gt;some HTC One cameras have this problem&lt;/a&gt;, and others don't. HTC will not replace the phone if it has this problem. They claim a forthcoming software update will fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for now, I just have to live with a crummy camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carrier-based Updates are Terrible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Google released Android 4.3. In early October, HTC and AT&amp;amp;T finally released new firmware that included Android 4.3. This was supposed to automatically download to my phone, but after a few weeks, it hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted AT&amp;amp;T about the problem. They were unhelpful, sending me the same set of instructions four times, then finally telling me to contact HTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC apologized for my difficulties, and sent me instructions for downloading an update package and installing it on the phone over USB. Unfortunately, their update procedure only works with a Windows computer, which I don't have. They apologized for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was eventually able to get the update installed by extracting the ROM image from the update package and using Android developer tools to flash it to the phone from my Mac, using instructions found on various Android hacker sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson: Don't buy a phone that makes you dependent upon the carrier and manufacturer to provide software updates. From now on, the only Android phones I buy will be Nexus or Google Play editions, which get timely OS updates directly from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Android 4.0, Android was ugly, slow, and clunky. Anyone who says otherwise is an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Android 4.0 eliminated a lot of the ugliness, and subsequent versions have addressed the slowness and clunkiness. Android is still not as attractive nor pleasant to use as iOS, but it is no longer embarrassingly bad in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Play store has a much better selection of apps than it did a couple of years ago. Android developers are making a lot of good apps with well-designed user experiences. However, the best Android apps are still not as good as the best iOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do like the openness of Android. I have grown dependent on some of the utilities that do things that wouldn't be allowed in iOS apps. For example, the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm"&gt;Tasker&lt;/a&gt; app can automate many activities. I have it set up so that my phone disables the unlock code when it sees my home wi-fi network, and then re-enables it when I leave. I have apps that automatically do things based upon whether I am in my car, or what time of day it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've played around with alternate lockscreen and homescreen apps. I've gone back to the standard ones, but having these choices is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't rooted my phone or installed any custom ROMs. My goal is to use the phone like "regular people" do, and most people don't do that. (Then again, most "regular people" with Android phones don't install many apps or use the web browser.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Android is getting better faster than iOS is. When my twelve-month enforced-Android-usage period is over, I think I'll probably stay with Android, unless Apple provides some amazing stuff in iOS 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTC One is a good product. It's a little big, but it works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to say whether I'd rather have this HTC One or a new iPhone. The HTC One seems more interesting, but that may be due to its newness. The iPhone is a great product, but it really hasn't changed much since its introduction, except for getting thinner and faster. The current crop of Android phones is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; better than last year's Android phones, but that's because last year's Android phones were terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nexus 5 was released this week. If I were to buy an Android phone today, that's probably what I'd get, but I'm hearing bad things about the camera.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="review"></category><category term="htcone"></category><category term="htc"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Trying Out CyanogenMod on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/trying-out-cyanogenmod-samsung-galaxy-tab-2-70.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-29T04:35:59-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-29T04:35:59-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-09-29:/trying-out-cyanogenmod-samsung-galaxy-tab-2-70.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year, I bought a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_2_7.0"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0&lt;/a&gt; for use as an Android development/testing device.

But it was cheap …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year, I bought a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_2_7.0"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0&lt;/a&gt; for use as an Android development/testing device. I didn't expect it to be good, and it wasn't. It was slow, clunky, and ugly in comparison to the iPad, just like every other Android tablet. But it was cheap, and I only used it to test apps I was developing, so it didn't bother me much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, it finally got an upgrade to Jelly Bean, which improved the slow/clunky aspects, but it still wasn't good. I bought a new Nexus 7 in July (which is an awesome Android tablet), so I went to &lt;a href="http://www.gazelle.com"&gt;gazelle.com&lt;/a&gt; to see what they would give me for a used Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Their offer: $16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it went into the old-devices drawer. I kept it only because I might need it in an emergency if my Nexus 7 died at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all the &lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/a_new_chapter"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/106978520009932034644/posts/L8FJkrcahPs"&gt;drama&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/about"&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt; (CM) broke last week, I decided I would give CyanogenMod a try. I was curious, and I had a device available to "sacrifice".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? That crummy old Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is actually a pretty nice tablet with CM installed. I now have an Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean tablet without all the Samsung TouchWiz crapware. It's not as good as the Nexus 7, but it no longer feels like junk, and it might stay out of that drawer for a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an Android device in your junk drawer (or a Kindle Fire, or a NOOK), you might want to give CM a try. Read on if you're interested.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation Pains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation wasn't easy, and is not recommended for non-technical users. If you've never flashed new firmware nor installed Linux on a computer, you may find it daunting. I expected problems, and was 50% certain I'd end up with a bricked device, but as I wrote above, this device was just one step away from the trash can anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the instructions on this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_p3110&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed the latest stable release, &lt;a href="http://get.cm/get/jenkins/42539/cm-10.1.3-p3110.zip"&gt;cm-10.1.3-p3110&lt;/a&gt; along with the corresponding &lt;a href="http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20130812-signed.zip"&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into three problems during the process. I'll describe the problems and their solutions here in case anyone else hits the same issues and runs across this page in a search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unable to Install ClockworkMod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before installing CM, one must install a custom &lt;a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/what-recovery-android-z"&gt;recovery&lt;/a&gt; partition that can be used to install CM. The suggested recovery is &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/ClockworkMod_Recovery"&gt;ClockworkMod&lt;/a&gt;, and installation is described in that &lt;em&gt;How to Install CyanogenMod&lt;/em&gt; document I was following. However, after following the steps in the document and then rebooting, booting into recovery resulted in me still having the standard default recovery, not ClockworkMod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through the steps a couple more times, and ended up with the same result. "Maybe I'm just not smart enough for CyanogenMod," I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled around. Eventually I stumbled on a forum posting that suggested that the stock ROM might be restoring the original recovery partition, and the trick was to make sure you boot into recovery before that happened. I don't know exactly what I did, but followed the steps one more time, taking care to ensure that I booted into recovery immediately after the downloader said it was finished, and it worked. I was in ClockworkMod!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unable to Install zip from sdcard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in ClockworkMod recovery, I was supposed to be able to choose the &lt;em&gt;Install zip from sdcard&lt;/em&gt; menu item and then select the &lt;code&gt;cm-10.1.3-p3110.zip&lt;/code&gt; file that I had earlier copied to the device's &lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt; directory. But when I selected that command, the file wasn't visible in the resulting list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rebooted into the normal device OS, and verified that &lt;code&gt;cm-10.1.3-p3110.zip&lt;/code&gt; was indeed in the &lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt; directory. Booted into recovery again, and again, unable to select that file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I chose the &lt;em&gt;Install from sideload&lt;/em&gt; command instead, and then did &lt;code&gt;adb sideload cm-10.1.3-p3110.zip&lt;/code&gt; from my Mac connected via USB. That worked. I then did the same thing with the Google Apps package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent research indicates that the zip files can be found by ClockworkMod in the &lt;code&gt;/sdcard/0/&lt;/code&gt; directory, rather than in &lt;code&gt;/sdcard/&lt;/code&gt;. This has something to do with support for multiple users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keyboard Not Functional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sideloading the CM and Google Apps packages, I rebooted the device, and CyanogenMod appeared on the screen. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. It asked me whether I wanted to set up a CyanogenMod account, and I clicked the button, and then it brought up the wi-fi selection screen, and I selected my wi-fi, and then it asked me for a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no keyboard was displayed. How does one enter a wi-fi password without a keyboard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just skipped through all the initial setup stuff. After I got to the Android home screen, every few seconds I got an error alert saying "Unfortunately, Android keyboard (AOSP) has stopped", indicating that the standard Android keyboard process was crashing repeatedly. That explained why no keyboard was displayed when I was prompted for my wi-fi password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to install &lt;a href="http://www.swiftkey.net"&gt;SwiftKey&lt;/a&gt;, my preferred Android keyboard. But how does one download something from Google Play if one can't enter the wi-fi password?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, more Googling. The most popular suggested fix for this problem was to go into Settings &amp;gt; Apps and clear data for the Android Keyboard and Dictionary Provider apps. I tried this, and it didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular suggestion was to try an older version of the Google Apps package. It didn't make sense to me that the Google Apps package would affect the standard Android keyboard, but I checked for older compatible Google Apps packages anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is how I discovered I had installed the wrong Google Apps package. I had installed the package designed for CM 4.2, but I had CM 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I rebooted back into recovery and installed the correct Google Apps package via sideload. For good measure, I also cleared the user data, the Dalvik cache and every other thing that seemed clearable or resettable in ClockworkMod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rebooted, and the keyboard worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected CyanogenMod to be weird, but it isn't. It generally looks and works just like my Nexus 7 does. I can access my Google contacts, calendar, and mail. I can download and run my purchased apps from the Google Play store (although there are a couple that are marked "incompatible with your device"). I can read my Kindle books. I can access all my Dropbox stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do see a few extra menu items in Settings, and there are probably a few magic features I haven't noticed yet, but if you are accustomed to pure Android as delivered in the Nexus devices, you'll find it familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any large open-source project, the community of developers and users are the only source of help. The CM community is a lot like the Linux community: there are a few smart helpful people, a few users sincerely offering and seeking assistance, and a lot of arrogant assholes who want to make everyone feel stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be part of that last group.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="galaxytab"></category><category term="cyanogenmod"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting Up a New Mac, My Way</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/setting-new-mac-my-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-30T18:02:30-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-30T18:02:30-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-08-30:/setting-new-mac-my-way.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of weeks, I've set up a few Mac OS X machines to do development of iOS and Android apps.

Doing this used to be an all-day chore, but things like app stores, iCloud, and Dropbox have streamlined the process a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I could streamline the process even more by cloning an existing drive or virtual machine, but I'd rather install everything from scratch to avoid the presence of old cruft.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder to myself, and to help out anyone else who needs to do this, here is my procedure for setting up an OS X machine &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2012/06/15/my-setup"&gt;the way I like it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install/re-install OS X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the OS X setup process, use the same login account name and password that I use on other computers, and provide the Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes (which are different, in my case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open System Preferences and do the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; panel, set &lt;em&gt;Sidebar icon size&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Small&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Show scroll bars&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Mission Control&lt;/em&gt; panel, uncheck the &lt;em&gt;Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use&lt;/em&gt; box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Mouse&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Trackpad&lt;/em&gt; panels, set all speeds to two ticks less than the maximums, and enable all the gestures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Keyboard&lt;/em&gt; panel, set &lt;em&gt;Key Repeat&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Delay Until Repeat&lt;/em&gt; all the way to the right, and check the &lt;em&gt;Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys&lt;/em&gt; box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Keyboard&lt;/em&gt; panel, go to the &lt;em&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/em&gt; tab, select &lt;em&gt;Services&lt;/em&gt;, and then enable the &lt;em&gt;New Terminal at Folder&lt;/em&gt; service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;iCloud&lt;/em&gt; panel, enable everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Sharing&lt;/em&gt; panel, set the &lt;em&gt;Computer Name&lt;/em&gt; to something unique (not "Kristopher's computer") and enable &lt;em&gt;Remote Management&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Remote Login&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;File Sharing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up &lt;em&gt;Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is a virtual machine, go to the &lt;em&gt;Desktop &amp;amp; Screen Saver&lt;/em&gt; panel and turn off the screen saver, and go to the &lt;em&gt;Energy Saver&lt;/em&gt; panel and set the sleep sliders to &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;em&gt;Software Update...&lt;/em&gt; menu item to install any system updates that are available, and reboot if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is a virtual machine, install VMWare Tools or Parallels Tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install these packages (using serial numbers and licenses stored in 1Password):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/gs"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; (and wait for everything to sync before continuing)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Open Xcode, accept the license agreement and download simulators and documentation. On a Terminal command line, execute &lt;code&gt;xcode-select --install&lt;/code&gt; to install the command-line tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href="http://brew.sh"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Terminal application and run &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt;. Download and install the JDK when prompted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html"&gt;ADT Bundle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;(Note: This is old; now Android Studio is the thing to download and install.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After installation, launch the Eclipse application. Choose the &lt;em&gt;Android SDK Manager&lt;/em&gt; menu item, and install/update everything in these subtrees:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android 4.3 (or whatever the newest API level is)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;em&gt;Help &amp;gt; Install New Software...&lt;/em&gt;. Click the &lt;em&gt;Add...&lt;/em&gt; button. Add this repository and install the Eclipse&amp;nbsp;Color&amp;nbsp;Theme plugin:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name: Eclipse Color Theme Update Site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location: &lt;code&gt;http://eclipse-color-theme.github.io/update/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install latest the HAXM driver from &lt;a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager"&gt;https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager&lt;/a&gt;. (If that link is broken, go to &lt;a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/"&gt;https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/&lt;/a&gt; and look for a HAXM download link.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; to run my shared scripts that are in &lt;code&gt;~/Dropbox/bin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute this in Terminal: &lt;code&gt;chflags nohidden ~/Library&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up ssh keys for &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=270827678"&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then to verify everything is ready to go, I use Git to grab the source code for an iOS app, and build it and run it, and then do the same for an Android app.&lt;/p&gt;

Googling for instructions found many hits, but many of those pages were a few years old, so the instructions didn't work anymore, or they didn't work with the HTC One, or were six-minute-long YouTube videos. So, I'm writing up some simple instructions that worked on my HTC&amp;nbsp;One. (They will probably work with other Android phones, but I'm not promising anything.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, on your computer with iTunes, find the ringtones you want to transfer. These will be files with a &lt;code&gt;.m4r&lt;/code&gt; extension. On my Mac, they were in the directory &lt;code&gt;/Users/kdj/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Tones&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you need some way to get the files onto your device's &lt;code&gt;/sdcard/Ringtones&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you have a Windows computer, I think you can just plug the phone into the computer and it will be mounted as a USB drive, so you can just drag and drop the files. If you have a Mac, you can either use the &lt;a href="http://www.android.com/filetransfer/"&gt;Android File Transfer&lt;/a&gt; application, or use something like &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you need to change the filename extensions of the files in &lt;code&gt;/sdcard/Ringtones&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;.m4r&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.m4a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the device you can go to Settings &amp;gt; Sound &amp;gt; Ringtone, and you should see your ringtones in the list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ringtones"></category><category term="itunes"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Solving "Symbol not found: _Perl_Gthr_key_ptr" When Running git-svn on Certain Unnamed Operating System Beta Versions</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/solving-symbol-not-found-perlgthrkeyptr-when-running-git-svn-certain-unnamed-operating-sy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-21T16:32:29-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-21T16:32:29-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-08-21:/solving-symbol-not-found-perlgthrkeyptr-when-running-git-svn-certain-unnamed-operating-sy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let's say that you are using a beta version of a new operating system that you can't name because it is covered by a non-disclosure agreement, and you have also installed the newest version of its development tools, which are also covered by NDA, and when you try to run …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let's say that you are using a beta version of a new operating system that you can't name because it is covered by a non-disclosure agreement, and you have also installed the newest version of its development tools, which are also covered by NDA, and when you try to run the &lt;code&gt;git svn&lt;/code&gt; command, you get this output:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Expected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dyld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_Perl_Gthr_key_ptr&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Referenced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/usr/../Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/SVN/_Core/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_Core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;svn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;died&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;signal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the problem is that &lt;code&gt;git-svn&lt;/code&gt; is implemented in Perl, and there is something wrong with the Perl configuration used when you run &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out you can fix this by putting the Git executables provided by the new development tools at the head of your PATH, by executing this command (or adding it to &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;export PATH=&amp;quot;/Applications/XXXXX.app/Contents/Developer/usr/libexec/git-core&amp;quot;:$PATH
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;XXXXX.app&lt;/code&gt; is the unnamed development tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can add all the command-line tools to your PATH like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;export PATH=”/Applications/XXXXX.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/”:$PATH
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Credit to &lt;a href="http://vandadnp.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/git-from-command-line-after-installing-xcode-on-os-x-lion/"&gt;Vandad Nahavandipoor&lt;/a&gt; for the hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to use the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcrun.1.html"&gt;xcrun&lt;/a&gt; utility to run &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;. You can do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;xcrun git svn blah-blah-blah
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or put this into your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; so that you don't have to remember to type &lt;code&gt;xcrun&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;alias git=&amp;#39;xcrun git&amp;#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are the kind of person who thinks its a good idea to replace system files with symlinks, you might try symlinking &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/git&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/Applications/XXXXX.app/Contents/Developer/usr/libexec/git-core/git&lt;/code&gt;. However, that alone doesn't work, because Git will still run the &lt;code&gt;git-svn&lt;/code&gt; executable from its default location, &lt;code&gt;/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/libexec/git-core&lt;/code&gt;, and you will still have the &lt;code&gt;_Perl_Gthr_key_ptr&lt;/code&gt; problem. So you also need to symlink the default location to &lt;code&gt;/Applications/XXXXX.app/Contents/Developer/usr/libexec/git-core/&lt;/code&gt;, or set the &lt;code&gt;GIT_EXEC_PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="perl"></category><category term="osx"></category><category term="git"></category><category term="dyld"></category><category term="bashrc"></category></entry><entry><title>Customizing Android Action Bar for Edit Mode</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/customizing-android-action-bar-edit-mode.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-25T13:06:38-04:00</published><updated>2013-07-25T13:06:38-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-07-25:/customizing-android-action-bar-edit-mode.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time trying to get a &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/actionbar.html"&gt;contextual action bar (CAB)&lt;/a&gt; working for an editing mode in an Android app I'm developing. My goal was to have a CAB appear whenever the user started changing field values on a screen, and the user would tap the &lt;em&gt;Done&lt;/em&gt; button …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time trying to get a &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/actionbar.html"&gt;contextual action bar (CAB)&lt;/a&gt; working for an editing mode in an Android app I'm developing. My goal was to have a CAB appear whenever the user started changing field values on a screen, and the user would tap the &lt;em&gt;Done&lt;/em&gt; button when complete. The CAB would also show a "Revert Changes" button allowing the user to undo whatever they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initially seemed like the easiest way to indicate to the user that they had made changes and needed to explicitly save them, but Android's default implementation of CAB has some drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standard button is titled "Done". I would prefer it to be "Save", but there is no easy-to-use &lt;code&gt;setTitle()&lt;/code&gt; method available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If user hits the &lt;em&gt;BACK&lt;/em&gt; button, the CAB disappears, and there is no straightforward way for the app to determine whether the CAB disappeared because the user hit Done or because they hit &lt;em&gt;BACK&lt;/em&gt;, or any way to intercept the processing of the &lt;em&gt;BACK&lt;/em&gt; button while a CAB is displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to write code to restore the CAB state on a &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html"&gt;configuration change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While browsing around the web trying to find examples of workarounds for these issues, I ran across a blog post explaining why using a CAB for this scenario won't work, even if I did fix the aforementioned problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dazcorp.blogspot.com/2013/04/edit-mode-and-why-using-contextual.html"&gt;Edit Mode and why using a Contextual ActionBar is a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Short version: If user double-taps or long-presses an edit field, it will pop up its own text-selection CAB which would blow away my CAB and eventually lead to a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm not using a CAB, but will instead customize the look of the non-contextual action bar as suggested in that blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="androiddev"></category><category term="android"></category><category term="actionbar"></category></entry><entry><title>Removing a Broken Lightning Connector Plug from an iPad or iPhone</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/removing-broken-lightning-connector-plug-ipad-or-iphone.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-29T18:20:32-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-29T18:20:32-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-06-29:/removing-broken-lightning-connector-plug-ipad-or-iphone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newer models of the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch use the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_(connector)"&gt;Lightning connector&lt;/a&gt; instead of the old 30-pin dock connectors.

The Lightning connector is smaller and you don't have to worry about inserting it upside-down, so on the whole this is a good change. However, the connector plug is not as sturdy as the old plug, and my wife somehow broke the plug off inside her iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is pretty easy to pull a broken plug out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a small screwdriver (small enough that the head will fit in the Lightning port)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put a small drop of super glue on the tip of the screwdriver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the screwdriver into the socket and hold it against the broken plug. Be careful not to touch the sides of the socket with the super glue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait about 30 seconds for the glue to set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull it out smoothly. The Lightning plug isn't held with much force, so this should be easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no way to repair the cable, so you'll have to go to your friendly neighborhood Apple Store and give them twenty bucks for a new one.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Android SDK Tools 22.0.1 Considered Harmful</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/android-sdk-tools-2201-considered-harmful.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-29T23:43:08-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-29T23:43:08-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-05-29:/android-sdk-tools-2201-considered-harmful.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After finishing up some work on an iOS app today, it was time to go make equivalent changes to the Android port of that app. "I'll just update my Android SDK before I get to work," I said (to myself).

I opened the Android SDK Manager and let it update these SDK packages to these versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android SDK Tools: 22.0.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android SDK Platform-tools: 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android SDK Build-tools: 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I let Eclipse update the ADT. Then I got to work. I opened my Android app project and tried to run it. I found I couldn't make a working debug build or a release build, nor could I create a signed APK to install on a device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of hair pulling, I got everything working. Here is what I learned. I hope it helps someone.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unable to resolve superclass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first problem was that, even though I could create an APK, when I tried to run it on a device I would see a bunch of "unable to resolve superclass" errors in the Logcat console. It looked like some of the JARs I was using (&lt;code&gt;android-support-v4.jar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gcm.jar&lt;/code&gt;, and some third-party libraries) weren't being included in the APK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually found the answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16583786/android-sdk-tools-revision-22-issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my app's code is in an Android library project, and then there is an application project that uses the library. Apparently revision 22 of the SDK breaks the way that application projects bring in JARs from a library project. To fix this, do the following on both the library project and the application project that uses the library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the project in Eclipse's Package Explorer and choose Properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;Java Build Path&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;Order and Export&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the boxes next to &lt;strong&gt;Android Private Libraries&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Android Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, do a clean and then rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this change, I was able to build an APK that installed and ran on an Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is apparently a bug with ADT 22. See https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=55304&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the release build working, I tried making a debug build to run in the debugger. I figured it would just work, but I saw this error in the console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Installation error: INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I verified that I had a &lt;code&gt;debug.keystore&lt;/code&gt; file, which is what should hold the certificates for a debug build. Sure enough, it existed, and hasn't been changed in a couple of years. I hadn't changed anything about my project or my &lt;code&gt;debug.keystore&lt;/code&gt;, but it looked like something about code signing has changed with the SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to delete my &lt;code&gt;debug.keystore&lt;/code&gt; file and let the SDK automatically recreate it. That solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="rant"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>UIColor Category for Specifying Packed RGB Values</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/uicolor-category-specifying-packed-rgb-values.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-19T00:36:53-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-19T00:36:53-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-05-19:/uicolor-category-specifying-packed-rgb-values.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;iOS's &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIColor_Class/Reference/Reference.html"&gt;UIColor&lt;/a&gt; class makes it pretty easy to specify a color using red, green, blue (RGB) and alpha components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, as with many Cocoa API's, it's pretty verbose. Web developers would specify that color using the hexcode shorthand &lt;code&gt;#ffff80&lt;/code&gt;, and many graphics editing tools would generate a hexcode value like that rather than values in the range 0.0&amp;ndash;1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made a simple category on UIColor that lets one write stuff like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;quot;UIColor+KDJPackedRGB.h&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// set pale yellow color&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;textColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithRGB24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0xffff80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=united+states+annual+deaths"&gt;Wolfram Alpha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In round numbers, that's &lt;em&gt;over 150,000 people dying every day&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;almost 7,000 people dying in the US every day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these deaths are those of elderly people passing away in their sleep. Many are unmourned. But many are &lt;em&gt;tragedies&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that a person has died too young, and grieving people are left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when the news presents reports of people dying, ask yourself: Why is the news reporting these deaths, and not the 150,000 other deaths that happened today around the world, or the 7,000 other deaths that happened today in the US?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it because the reported deaths are more important than all the others, or is it because somebody found a way to make &lt;em&gt;dramatic stories&lt;/em&gt; out of these particular deaths? Are the reported deaths indicative of larger patterns or important trends, or are they interesting because they happened in a public place and there is video available from several angles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, your chance of being killed by a terrorist or a mass shooter or an airplane crash or flesh-eating bacteria or a meteor or anything else reported by the media is almost equal to zero. These events are reported on the evening news &lt;em&gt;because they are so rare&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be careful about letting what you see on the news control your fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is silly to worry about terrorists and mass shooters if you smoke cigarettes, eat a lot of fast food, or use your mobile phone while driving. The latter activities could kill you; the former just don't happen often enough for any reasonable person to worry about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to turn your home into an armed fortress to protect your family from dangerous people. Before you do that, you should ensure that your family is eating healthy meals, getting lots of exercise, and getting regular medical checkups. You are more likely to save somebody's life by learning CPR and First Aid techniques than by learning martial arts or small-arms tactics. Make sure all the smoke detectors have fresh batteries before you worry about installing a high-tech security system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone asks you to pray for the victims of some tragic event, ask why you should pray just for them, and not for the one million people who died in other ways that week, or for the million that died the previous week, or for the million who will die the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When somebody tells you that thousands of people are killed every year by some disease or government policy or widespread moral failing, and insists that drastic measures are justified to prevent those deaths, think about the 2.5 million Americans who die of other causes every year. If someone claims that a new law or policy is worthwhile "even if it saves only one child", consider whether resources might be better devoted to policies that save hundreds, thousands, or millions of children instead of just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not suggesting that we do nothing to try to prevent deaths, or that we should not care when strangers die. If you can save one person's life, you have done more good than most people will ever do. I'm just suggesting that you remember the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With billions of people in the world, it will always be easy to find instances of evil people doing horrible things, and of innocent people dying in tragic circumstances. But remember, while around 150,000 people die every day, a larger number are born, and billions of people just go on living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your chances of making it through the day are pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="rant"></category></entry><entry><title>Home Depot Two-Year Replacement Plan Doesn't</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/home-depot-two-year-replacement-plan-doesnt.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-13T23:09:28-04:00</published><updated>2013-04-13T23:09:28-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-04-13:/home-depot-two-year-replacement-plan-doesnt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I bought a Yard Machines lawn mower from Home Depot last year, I paid for a 2-year repair/replacement plan.

I'm pretty sure the plan was presented to me with language like "If it stops working, you just bring it back and we'll replace it." I've had some bad luck with lawn equipment, and the price wasn't high, so it seemed like a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the mower won't start. So I try to get Home Depot to repair or replace it. Home Depot's response is that the product is covered by a manufacturer's warranty, so I must get service from the manufacturer. The website helpfully tells me that I can contact the manufacturer by calling "$MFR_PHONE$". (That's verbatim.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Home Depot's repair/replacement plan was literally worthless. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contact the Yard Machines warranty service. They say that their warranty doesn't cover the engine. The engine is covered by the engine's manufacturer (Briggs &amp;amp; Stratton).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yard Machines provides a warranty that doesn't cover the engine? Isn't a lawn mower just an engine attached to a blade and wheels? It's as if a warranty for a computer didn't cover any of the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I go to the Briggs &amp;amp; Stratton website. It says I can get warranty service by an Authorized Briggs &amp;amp; Stratton Dealer in my area. I enter my zip code. Results: No dealers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so now I have to wonder how many more hours I want to spend trying to get this thing fixed. Probably easier to either hire a lawn-mowing service, figure out how to fix it myself, or buy a new mower. But not from Home Depot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, here are recent additions to my Shit List:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home Depot&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on requirements and guidelines for iOS app icons, see &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1"&gt;iOS Human Interface Guidelines: Icons and …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, I have to tell a graphic designer all the sizes needed for iOS and Android icons. So I'm putting together a summary here for easy reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on requirements and guidelines for iOS app icons, see &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1"&gt;iOS Human Interface Guidelines: Icons and Image Sizes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1686/_index.html"&gt;Technical Q&amp;amp;A QA1686: App Icons on iPad and iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All icons must be in PNG format with 24-bit color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;App Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an app for iOS 7 and later, we need icon image files in these sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1024 x 1024&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;512 x 512&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;228 x 228&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;180 x 180&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;152 x 152&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120 x 120&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87 x 87&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80 x 80&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;76 x 76&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;58 x 58&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 x 40&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 x 29&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;144 x 144 (if supporting iOS 6.1 or earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;114 x 114 (if supporting iOS 6.1 or earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100 x 100 (if supporting iOS 6.1 or earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;72 x 72 (if supporting iOS 6.1 or earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;57 x 57 (if supporting iOS 6.1 or earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 x 50 (if supporting iOS 6.1 or earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS icons are opaque. Note that iOS will automatically round the corners and add the glossy shine effect when it displays the icon. You may want to pre-render the shine effect if you want more control over how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toolbar, Navigation Bar, and Tab Bar Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use pure white and transparent regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not include a drop shadow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use anti-aliasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For toolbar and navigation bar icons, create images with these sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22 x 22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44 x 44 (high resolution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tab bar icons, create images with these sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 x 25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 x 50 (high-resolution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each toolbar, navigation bar, or tab bar icon, you may provide a single image, which iOS will treat as a template to generate unselected and selected appearances, or you may provide two images: one for the unselected appearance and another for the selected appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the sizes given for toolbar, navigation bar, and tab bar icons here are approximate. Images may be slightly larger or slightly smaller than these sizes. Give all icons in a bar a similar visual weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple Watch Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the iOS app includes an Apple Watch app, the following icons are needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notification Center Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 x 29 (38mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36 x 36 (42mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Long Look Notification Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80 x 80 (38mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;88 x 88 (42mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Home Screen Icon and Short Look Icon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;172 x 172 (38mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;196 x 196 (42mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Menu Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70 x 70, with content size 46 x 46 (38mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80 x 80, with content size 54 x 54 (42mm watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watch Companion Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;58 x 58&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87 x 87&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;App Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an Android app launcher icon, we need PNG image files in these sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;512 x 512 (Google Play)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;144 x 144 (xxhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;96 x 96 (xhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;72 x 72 (hdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48 x 48 (mdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Android app icons don't have to be square: the alpha channel can be used to create transparent areas, so an icon should have a distinct silhouette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the app generates notifications, then we need a 24 x 24 icon image. Notification icons must be entirely white except for transparent regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on requirements and guidelines for Android app icons, see &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_launcher.html"&gt;Launcher Icons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html"&gt;Iconography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action Bar Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;96 x 96 (xxhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;64 x 64 (xhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48 x 48 (hdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 x 32 (mdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Small/Contextual Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48 x 48 (xxhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 x 32 (xhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24 x 24 (hdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 x 16 (mdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notification Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;72 x 72 (xxhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48 x 48 (xhdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36 x 36 (hdpi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24 x 24 (mdpi)&lt;/li&gt;

This would have been my first half marathon, and I've been training for the past two months to run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the event was cancelled due to lightning and poor course conditions after several hours of thunderstorms. So all I got out of it was a very expensive t-shirt.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
It was a stormy two-and-a-half-hour drive each way. I awoke around 4 AM. I arrived at Berry College before 7 AM, prepared for a start time of 8 AM, but that was pushed back to 9 AM due to the weather. Then it was delayed to 9:30, then to 10:00, but at 9:45 they announced the race was cancelled. I got back home at around 1:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had not run, my body was sore because I had been standing out in the rain for a few hours and drove home with cold wet socks and shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a nap, then decided to go to the park and run 13.1 miles all by myself, because dammit, I was gonna run a half marathon today and nobody was gonna stop me. I only made it six miles before calling it quits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to get a half marathon behind me. I am getting bored with running, so I want to get that goal achieved so that I can move on to some new interest. I won't quit running entirely, but I would rather focus on improving my 10K times than on doing longer runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a &lt;a href="http://www.active.com/running/blairsville-ga/northeast-georgia-run-2013"&gt;half marathon event in Blairsville&lt;/a&gt; that will run two weeks from now, so I'm planning to enter that. However, that is the day after our fifth wedding anniversary, so I won't run if it would interfere with an appropriate celebration of that milestone. Maybe we can rent a cabin up in Blairsville for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't register for a running event too far in advance. I registered for this event back in January, having set it as my goal for training, but it has been obvious for the past week that the weather would be terrible. It's cheaper to register farther in advance, but I'd rather pay more to know what the weather will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't register for a running event that is more than an hour-and-a-half away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need better rain gear. I have a couple of water-resistant jackets, but they are not waterproof, so they get soaked through after 30 minutes or so. I want something light but waterproof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always take an extra pair of dry socks, an extra pair of shoes, and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Knowing_where_one.27s_towel_is"&gt;towel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.active.com/running/Articles/How_to_Taper_for_Your_Road_Race"&gt;Tapering&lt;/a&gt; for two weeks before the race doesn't seem to have helped me prepare. I ran 12 miles three weeks ago, but then 9 miles and 8 miles the past two weekends, and now I have trouble running more than six miles. In the future, I'll keep my long runs long, and take it easy for only 3-4 days before the race.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also seemed a little silly for such a web page to require a back-end service to do the work. I figured I could whip up a simple web page that wouldn't require any server round-trips to do its work, and that produced reformatted output that wouldn't make me cry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some JSON files that were not indented consistently. I edit these files by hand, so I wanted a way to easily reformat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My text editor has a reformatting command, but I really hate what it produces, so I decided to make my own JSON reformatting service for OS X that I could use in any application.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
First, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; script to do the reformatting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/5065599.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also available as &lt;a href="http://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/5153772"&gt;Literate CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saved that file as &lt;code&gt;~/bin/formatjson&lt;/code&gt;, and made it executable with &lt;code&gt;chmod +x ~/bin/formatjson&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I used Automator to create a service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch Automator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Automator document of type &lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set it to "Service receives selected &lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;any application&lt;/strong&gt;", and check the &lt;strong&gt;Output replaces selection text&lt;/strong&gt; box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag a &lt;em&gt;Run Shell Script&lt;/em&gt; action into the workflow, and enter the following command:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PATH=$PATH:~/bin:/usr/local/bin formatjson&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the service with the name "Reformat JSON Text".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: In step 4, if your &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; executable is not in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;, then substitute the appropriate directory. Also, if you saved &lt;code&gt;formatjson&lt;/code&gt; to a directory other than &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt;, substitute the appropriate directory for that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/undefinedvalue/ReformatJSONTextService.png" height="413" width="600" alt="Automator screenshot"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I want to reformat some JSON in a text editor, I just select it, right-click, and choose &lt;strong&gt;Services&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Reformat&amp;nbsp;JSON&amp;nbsp;Text&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I want to reformat things from the command line, this works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Least attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using SourceTree for the past year, and while I do remember some confusion when I first used it, it feels very easy to use now. I like its support of Subversion and of git-flow, and I think it has the most useful screen layout. However, it is ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.git-tower.com"&gt;http://www.git-tower.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visually attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not free, most expensive ($59)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not available from Mac App Store (If I have to pay for a Mac app, that's where I want to buy it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inefficient UI (too much empty space, too many clicks required to perform common operations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only shows one repository at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower is the prettiest of the bunch, but feels inefficient, and is a lot more expensive than the other options. When the 30-day trial expires, I will delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gitbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gitboxapp.com"&gt;http://gitboxapp.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimalistic (in a good way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not free (but only $15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimalistic (in a bad way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No integrated diff-viewer. Viewing differences requires launching an external tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitbox is focused on making it easy to commit changes with a few keystrokes. It is not very good for browsing through changes, due to the need to use an external app to view changes. This app isn't appealing to me. I don't need a GUI to quickly make commits: I use the command line for that. I like having a GUI to make it easy for me to review changes before I commit or push, and Gitbox doesn't help me with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitX-dev&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/rowanj/gitx"&gt;https://github.com/rowanj/gitx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open-source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clumsy staging workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels a lot like SourceTree, but is not as polished. It is nice that it's open-source/free-as-in-speech, but if all one cares about is free-as-in-beer, SourceTree is the better free option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mac.github.com"&gt;http://mac.github.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice integration with GitHub.com website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attractive easy-to-use UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feels dumbed-down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend this to someone who only uses Git in association with GitHub. It is easy to use and is a great match for the workflow promoted by GitHub. But as a general-purpose Git client, it seems to be missing some features (or maybe I just didn't try hard enough to find them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically work alone. Sometimes I work with one other developer. I don't have to worry much about merging or keeping track of lots of commits by other developers. So, what I want from a Git client may be different from what others need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the command line for anything "complicated". I don't trust the GUIs to do what I expect. All Git GUIs should provide some sort of log that indicates exactly what git operations they have performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like I will stick with SourceTree, but I will force myself to use the others once in a while. SourceTree feels right to me, but I wonder whether that is due more to familiarity than to actual goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably recommend GitHub for Mac to any newbies who ask.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="github"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>iOS UI Automation Cheatsheet</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/ios-ui-automation-cheatsheet.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-22T16:00:46-05:00</published><updated>2013-02-22T16:00:46-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-02-22:/ios-ui-automation-cheatsheet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have just learned about Apple's UI Automation testing framework.

&lt;li&gt;Assign an &lt;code&gt;accessibilityIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; to each UI element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;UIATarget.onAlert&lt;/code&gt; to handle externally generated alerts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;UIAElement.logElementTree()&lt;/code&gt; to figure out how to navigate the visual hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a value doesn't change when expected, try adding &lt;code&gt;UIATarget.delay(1);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Valued Customer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this purchase, please RATE us 5 STARS and write a POSITIVE Customer Review on amazon.com within the next 7 days. This will activate your FREE ONE YEAR WARRANTY* and give you PRIORITY customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*FREE ONE YEAR WARRANTY covers defects in material and workmanship. Merchandise may be returned for repair, replacement or store credit at company's sole discretion. To qualify for this warranty, customer must have left a 5-star rating and a positive customer review on amazon.com within 7 days of receipt of merchandise."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right: they offer a warranty that covers defects, but only if you help them sell their products to other unsuspecting customers. It's little wonder that they have an average 4.9-star rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of gaming of rating and review systems really bugs me, so I contacted Amazon customer support. They told me that this is indeed a violation of their Marketplace policies, and that sellers who do this kind of thing can be banned from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you ever see something like this, go to http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/reports, select "Report a violation of our rules" and provide the details. Amazon will investigate and take appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, leave the seller a one-star review.

&lt;p&gt;My wife is a science teacher in a public school. She worked her way through college and obtained a Masters degree and a Ph.D. She could have taken a position in university academia, but decided she could do more good in a classroom with students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She works in one of the wealthiest districts of one of the wealthiest counties in the state. She teaches the children of dentists, lawyers, and accountants who spend their weekends on the golf course complaining about being crushed by taxes and arguing about which model of BMW to buy this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She always works over 60 hours per week. She works harder than anyone I've ever seen in private industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her pay has been cut by about 25% over the past five years. A big chunk of what income she has left goes toward buying supplies that the school system and parents won't provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's a &lt;em&gt;taker&lt;/em&gt;. She's a leech sucking society's blood.

&lt;p&gt;My wife called DirecTV and told them about the problems …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, two of our DirecTV satellite receivers failed. The failures were unrelated: one stopped working after the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke"&gt;magic smoke&lt;/a&gt; leaked out of the vents; the other kept rebooting itself and scanning its disk, without ever actually starting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife called DirecTV and told them about the problems. The customer service rep agreed to send a replacement for the receiver that was smoking. However, we would have to let the other receiver keep trying to scan/repair its disk for 48 hours before they would declare it dead and replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days went by, and we received a replacement receiver. We hooked it up and called DirecTV to activate it, and that went fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'd call this reasonable service. Then we asked about the other failed receiver, which was still not working after 48 hours, and that's when things changed.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Special Circumstances&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rep who helped us activate the replacement receiver for Old Smokey looked at what he could do about the other receiver. It turned out that, because we have had multiple receiver failures and replacements, he had to pass us over to a &lt;em&gt;special case manager&lt;/em&gt;. The special case manager was, of course, not available at that time, so we had to agree to let him call us the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special case manager called at dinner time. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with him. Most of that time consisted of the following questions, asked repeatedly, with a few minutes of on-hold music once in a while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you doing with your receivers that causes them to fail?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many receivers do you have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why don't your receivers' serial numbers match our records?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be &lt;em&gt;very unfortunate&lt;/em&gt; if we had to charge you a lost-equipment fee for the receivers you cannot account for. I'm &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to help you. Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; you don't have any other receivers you haven't told me about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of questioning, the manager told me he wasn't going to honor my request to replace the bad-disk-drive receiver, because they had &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; replaced it, according to their records. And I didn't admit to having a receiver that their records said I did have. What had happened to that receiver?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to me that when we made the original call about the two broken receivers, the rep recorded that they were sending a replacement for the bad-disk receiver instead of the smoking receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So according to their records, I was supposed to still have a receiver I sent back, and not supposed to have a receiver they sent me. In the manager's mind, that meant there were &lt;em&gt;two receivers&lt;/em&gt; unaccounted for. He kept asking the same questions in different ways, clearly convinced that I was lying or withholding information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been paying DirecTV over a hundred dollars per month for several years. Do they really think we did that as a scam to steal one of their receivers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You Are Free to Go...But Don't Leave Town&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 40 minutes of interrogation, he finally said, "Oh, I see what must have happened. That representative must have recorded the wrong ID. Let me fix that for you. Thank you for your patience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe he gave up on proving my guilt. Maybe it took him 40 minutes to accept that someone could have made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, he made it sound like I should be grateful that he was able to straighten things out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he let me know he'd be calling again to check up on me. If any more mysterious receiver failures happen, he'll give us his personal attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the day when we can cancel DirecTV and get all our TV programs via the Internet. I think DirecTV knows how close we all are to that point, and they are milking us for all they can while they still have a business.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="rant"></category><category term="directv"></category></entry><entry><title>46</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/46.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-17T13:43:20-05:00</published><updated>2013-01-17T13:43:20-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2013-01-17:/46.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another year behind me.

I've been able to do more mobile and web development, and will be doing some embedded-systems development soon. I may be able to put Windows/.NET development behind me for a while. I was able to give myself a nice bump in my hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family and dogs are doing fine. There is nothing very interesting to report, but I'm happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're planning to visit relatives in North Dakota this summer. I haven't been back there for a while (over ten years, I think), so it will be nice to see everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm healthier than I was a year ago. I &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2013/01/01/couch-potato-running-10k-few-months"&gt;started running&lt;/a&gt; in August, and ran a 10K on New Year's Day. I have started training to run a half-marathon at the end of March. I've lost a few pounds and a few waistline inches. If I can lose 20 pounds this year, I'll be in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals for the coming year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write in my journal every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a half marathon, and the Peachtree Road Race 10K. (Maybe: run Atlanta Marathon this fall.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice guitar at least six days per week. My wife bought me a nice Fender Telecaster for Christmas/birthday, which has been a good motivator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to play keyboard. My brother bought me a keyboard for Christmas/birthday, so I have no excuses not to learn to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at this list of goals once in a while.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as I started thinking "Maybe I should start running again," I ran across a mention of the &lt;a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml"&gt;Couch-to-5K&lt;/a&gt; running plan in a blog. The core idea is that the plan &lt;em&gt;very gradually&lt;/em&gt; builds up your endurance. Too many people decide "I need to start running," then go out and run a couple of miles, and then wake up in pain the following morning and decide they will never run again. C25K starts you off alternating between 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking the first week, then 90 seconds of jogging and two minutes of walking the second week, then keeps bumping up the jogging time and reducing the walking time until you are running for 30 minutes straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first couple of weeks of C25K seemed really easy, and I was tempted to skip forward a couple of weeks, but I'm glad I didn't. I think its gradual nature is the key to its success. Every other time I've gotten into running, I've had problems with pain in my right ankle, but that didn't happen this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href="http://www.active.com/mobile/c25k"&gt;iPhone app&lt;/a&gt; that will tell you when to start running and when to start walking, so it appealed to both the geeky and lazy aspects of my personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished C25K in October, and was surprised at how easy it had been. So I decided to follow up with the &lt;a href="http://www.active.com/mobile/10k"&gt;5K-to-10K&lt;/a&gt; program, which also has an iPhone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected going from 5K to 10K to be easier than going from 0 to 5K, but it wasn't. The first few weeks were easy, but once I got up to about five miles, it was tough to keep going. But I did it, and a few weeks ago I did my first 60-minute continuous run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this coincided with the holiday season, so while I lost 10 pounds between August and December, I put five pounds back on during December. I'll have to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, New Year's Day, I ran the &lt;a href="http://atlantatrackclub.org/events/view/2013-pt-solutions-resolution-run"&gt;2013 PT Solutions Resolution Run 10K&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the Atlanta Track Club. It was 45 degrees and raining, so it wasn't pleasant, but I did finish, running the whole 6.2 miles except for brief walks at the water stations. My time was one hour and three minutes, which is not great, but I'm happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

I worked on half a dozen different operating systems, and during the course of a day it was common to use four or five different computers, only one or two of which were in my cubicle. I'd spend weeks at customer sites. I often sat side-by-side with other developers to work through issues. Every few weeks, a new machine would appear or another machine would disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to decide that I should never treat any computer as "mine", no matter how often I used it or how little anyone else used it. So I didn't spend time customizing any of the system or application settings to suit me. I didn't mess with the keyboard bindings. I didn't write a lot of scripts or macros. I tried to become as adept as possible at using the "stock configuration" of every tool. The extent of my customization was copying a &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file from machine to machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This habit was reinforced when I got into Windows development, and found that I needed to re-install Windows from scratch every couple of months to keep things running well, and that I had to help non-technical users figure out how to fix their machines. Sticking to the stock configuration and standard applications seemed to be the only way to stay sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often rolled my eyes when I'd hear someone talk about how hyperproductive they were with their Dvorak keyboard layout and customized desktop shell and macro recorders. "Great", I'd think, "but can you also be productive with the computer in the neighboring cubicle, or the computer at your parents' house?"  I was proud that I could sit down in front of any computer, and not need to worry about how to work without All My Stuff with me. As the Buddhists say, attachment is the cause of suffering, so let go of your attachments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I've finally started to relax this stock-configuration-only policy. A few things have changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do practically all my work with my own personally owned laptop. I always have it with me, at every work location and at my home. Even when I have to do something with another computer, I often do so by connecting to it from my laptop. So my machine really is "mine", and I rarely touch another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox, iCloud, GitHub, and similar services make it easy to keep All My Stuff in sync between machines, and to set up a brand-new machine the way I want it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm no longer stuck with using Windows most of the time. Mac OS X is a lot easier to customize and automate, due to its UNIX underpinnings. (Yes, seriously.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I've found most useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/"&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt;: This thing is awesome. Key rebinding was the customization I put off the longest, due to concerns about the need to memorize a bunch of new keyboard shortcuts and the need to find keys that were not already used by my applications, but now that I've dived in, I like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredapp.com"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;: a nice app launcher. I've also tried QuickSilver and LaunchBar, but decided I prefer the simplicity of Alfred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html"&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automator and the Services menu: While not as useful as they could be, due to Apple's on-again-off-again interest in supporting and promoting them, they are great for hooking little scripts into my workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safari Extensions: If you know a bit about JavaScript and the DOM, you can automate a lot of common web activities, and even customize website behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are things that I've experimented with, and decided to avoid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AppleScript. I use it when I have to, but it is the &lt;strong&gt;worst scripting language ever created&lt;/strong&gt;. Whenever I can use bash, Python, or JavaScript instead, I do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application-specific macros. Some applications provide their own mechanisms for replaying sequences of keystrokes or triggering scripts. I use these when they make sense, but it is generally better to let Keyboard Maestro, TextExpander, or the Services menu take care of them system-wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech recognition: The Mac has long had a speech recognition system that lets you do a lot of things by just telling it to do so. However, this has never been as useful as, for example, Siri on the iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing everything suggested by Merlin Mann, Brett Terpstra, Dr. Drang, and MacSparky. Those are all smart people who figure out some cool stuff, but it's easy to get bogged down trying to use it all. It's better to examine your own workflow and improve it than it is to try to adopt someone else's workflow. (It also makes me feel stupid when it takes me longer to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; that stuff than it takes them to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of customizing my computer has changed the way I use it. Whenever I do the same sequence of steps more than a couple of times, I stop and think about whether there is a way to make it faster or easier. Often the answer is not to customize the machine further, but to change my own work habits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scripting"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="automator"></category></entry><entry><title>Node.js Cheatsheet</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/nodejs-cheatsheet.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-20T15:54:01-05:00</published><updated>2012-11-20T15:54:01-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2012-11-20:/nodejs-cheatsheet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am learning about &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://npmjs.org"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; - package manager for Node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor"&gt;supervisor&lt;/a&gt; - automatically restarts Node-based server when files change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon"&gt;nodemon&lt;/a&gt; - automatically restarts Node-based server when files change&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jfromaniello.github.com/winser/"&gt;Winser&lt;/a&gt; - runs Node as a Windows service, using &lt;a href="http://nssm.cc"&gt;nssm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/"&gt;docco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/mbrevoort/docco-husky"&gt;docco-husky&lt;/a&gt; - documentation generator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector"&gt;node-inspector&lt;/a&gt; - browser-based debugging interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These libraries are especially useful (to me, for what I have done):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://expressjs.com"&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; - web application framework&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See https://npmjs.org for a complete list of all available modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a New Web App with the Express Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't already have the Express framework installed, do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;npm install -g express
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To create a new app, do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;express --sessions MyNewApp
cd MyNewApp
npm install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To run the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cd MyNewApp
node app
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By default, the app will listen for requests on port 3000, so you can browse to http://locahost:3000/ to view the app. Modify &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; or set the &lt;code&gt;PORT&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to use a different port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem was that, while I could find Havenjark theme files for Eclipse and Textmate/Sublime Text 2, I could not find one for Xcode. So I converted the Eclipse color theme to Xcode 4's color theme format by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to try Havenjark in Xcode 4 yourself, download &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/havenjark/raw/master/Havenjark.dvtcolortheme"&gt;Havenjark.dvtcolortheme&lt;/a&gt; and copy it to your &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/&lt;/code&gt; directory. Then, in Xcode, go to &lt;em&gt;Preferences&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Fonts &amp;amp; Colors&lt;/em&gt; and select it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theme uses the Bitstream Vera Sans Mono font, which you can download for free from various locations on the Internet, or you can just change the font to something of your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to bother converting this to Visual Studio's color-theme format.

The old iMac was attached to a wall mount using Apple's &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD179ZM/A"&gt;VESA Mount Adapter&lt;/a&gt;, so I had to remove the old iMac from that adapter and attach the new iMac to it.  That went fine, but then I had problems re-connecting the original stand to the old iMac.  What follows is what I learned, and I hope it helps others who have the same problem.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
When you connect an iMac to a VESA adapter, you first have to remove the iMac's stand. This procedure is described in the VESA adapter manual, and it is not difficult. Unfortunately, that manual does not tell you how to reattach the stand to the iMac when you no longer want it mounted to a wall, and simply following the manual in reverse doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complication is that there is a latch inside an iMac that keeps the stand at a range of angles that hides the screws. The VESA adapter kit comes with a little credit-card-sized plastic "access card" that you slide into the stand slot to release the latch and "lock" it into the position needed to remove the screws and connect the VESA adapter.  But when you take the VESA adapter off and reconnect the stand, it is not obvious how to unlock that latch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one time I really wish the back of the iMac was transparent. It would have been nice to see the latch to figure out how to unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some head-scratching and Googling and trial and error, I got the latch unlocked. Here's how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lay the iMac face down on a table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-attach the iMac stand to the flange using the 8 screws. Note that you will need to position the stand such that its bottom hangs off the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push down slightly on the stand to expose the latch, and insert the access card at a low angle (that is, don't insert it by pressing directly toward the table, but try to slide it toward the top of the iMac).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you feel the card moving the latch, lift on the stand and it should go into the proper position.  If not, repeat the previous step at a slightly different angle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give credit where it's due, here are the online forum postings that I found most helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gravatar.com"&gt;Gravatar&lt;/a&gt; is a free service that allows you to save your avatar (picture) for use by multiple websites. Gravatar has a copy of the avatar I wanted, so I hoped I could just download it via the same user interface you use to upload images. It turns out that you can't do that: the user interface lets you upload pictures, but does not provide a download option. So I had to figure out how to retrieve my image the way that a Gravatar web client would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/"&gt;Gravatar documentation&lt;/a&gt;, one can get a image for a user by doing an HTTP GET with a URL of this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/HASH
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;HASH&lt;/code&gt; is the MD5 hash of the user's email address. You can calculate this using the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/md5.1.html"&gt;md5&lt;/a&gt; command-line utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here is the complete command line that will calculate my MD5 hash and the retrieve the image using the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/curl.1.html"&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; utility:&lt;/p&gt;

I hit a few snags, and I found very little information about the process, or help in online forums, and Apple Support assistance was very slow. So I'm documenting what I learned here. I hope it helps someone.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;custom B2B app&lt;/em&gt; is an iOS app that is distributed through the App Store, but which is only available for purchase by a specific set of customers.  It lets you take advantage of the App Store infrastructure while still restricting distribution of the app.  Thus, it can be an attractive alternative to using the iOS Enterprise Developer Program or ad-hoc deployment to distribute in-house apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some significant restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customers must be members of Apple's &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/business/vpp/"&gt;Volume Purchase Program&lt;/a&gt; (VPP). To enroll in the program, the customer must have a DUNS number. To purchase apps, the customer must use the VPP portal rather than going through the usual App Store mechanisms. When the customer purchases apps through the VPP, they receive redemption codes when they can then distribute to employees for installation on devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The VPP is currently only available in the US. (It is "coming soon" to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and United Kingdom.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though the apps are targeted at the needs of a specific set of customers, they still must go through Apple's review process, which takes time and could result in a rejection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There used to be another restriction: B2B apps had to have a minimum price of $9.99, and Apple would take a 30% commission. This may not seem like a significant restriction, but many potential customers would balk at paying a per-download price for a custom app after paying up-front development costs. However, Apple recently changed the rules to allow custom B2B apps to be distributed for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/"&gt;WWDC 2012 session video&lt;/a&gt; "Building and Distributing Custom B2B Apps for IOS" is worth watching if you are interested in distributing a B2B app. (Note that you'll need to be a registered iOs developer to access this video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To distribute a custom B2B app, one must be a member of the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/"&gt;iOS Developer Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, one must agree to the iOS Paid Applications agreement, and must provide banking and tax information to Apple. This is true &lt;em&gt;even if your custom B2B apps will be free.&lt;/em&gt; (I don't know why this is true, but I suspect it has something to do with the original requirement that B2B apps have a minimum price.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Submission and Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, submitting a B2B app to the App Store works just like submitting a for-the-public app. You first create the new app in iTunes Connect, then you use Xcode to upload the binary, then you wait for Apple to approve it. Here is what is different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need the Apple ID associated with each customer's VPP account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating the app in iTunes Connect, on the page where you set the Availability Date and Price Tier, there is a &lt;em&gt;Custom B2B App&lt;/em&gt; checkbox. Check it, and you will be able to enter the customers' Apple IDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the app is approved for sale, your customers purchase redemption codes from the VPP portal. It will not be available in the App Store app or iTunes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you cannot convert a regular app to a B2B app, or vice versa. Once it is created one way, you can't change it. For a B2B app, you can add Apple IDs for additional customers after creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is my own personal history of trying to get this stuff set up, and the snags we hit ("we" meaning myself, my colleagues and customers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background is that we had initially deployed an app to a customer's employees using ad-hoc distribution to a set of about 20 devices. The customer decided to roll the app out to a few hundred more employees, so we looked at the options, and when Apple announced that VPP apps no longer had a minimum-price restriction, we decided to go down that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial attempt to add a new free custom B2B app in iTunes Connect failed. The B2B option was not available on the screen where it was supposed to be. We eventually guessed that we'd need to accept the iOS Paid Applications agreement (even though the app was free). After doing that, then the B2B option was available. I submitted the app, and waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a week, the status went from "Waiting for Review" to "in Review", but we immediately received a message stating that the app would require additional review time. I don't know whether all B2B apps require additional review, or if there was something about our app that raised questions, or if it was just because it went into review on the Fourth of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five days later, the status changed to "Ready for Sale". Mission accomplished, right? No. The customer reported that they could not see the app in their VPP portal. We found information online stating that once an app was accepted, it might take 24 hours before it would be visible. So we waited 24 hours. Customer still couldn't see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days of exchanging email with Apple Support, we finally heard that we needed to supply banking and tax information to Apple (even though the app is free). So we did that, and then the customer could see the app in their VPP portal. Woo-hoo! Now we're done, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. When the customer attempted to "purchase" the free app, they got an error message saying "An unknown error occurred". So we send more email to Apple Support. Eventually somebody at Apple gives me a phone call, and tells me everything is set up correctly in iTunes Connect and the App Store, so there is nothing more we needed to do, and that the customer needed to contact VPP support to resolve their purchasing issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We told the customer they would need to contact VPP support. The customer reported dissatisfaction with VPP support (the word "sucks" was used). The customer was also annoyed to discover that their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management"&gt;MDM&lt;/a&gt; solution, MaaS360, supports purchase of App Store apps, but does not support purchase of custom B2B apps through the VPP. Thus, when they download redemption codes from the VPP, they have to manually mail them out to employees, rather than relying on the MDM to automatically update the managed devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the end result is that the customer didn't love this solution, but they can live with it. If we consider the B2B route with any future customers, we will definitely have some discussions about the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iosdev"></category><category term="b2b"></category><category term="appstore"></category></entry><entry><title>Entity Framework Cheatsheet</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/entity-framework-cheatsheet.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-11T14:46:54-04:00</published><updated>2012-07-11T14:46:54-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2012-07-11:/entity-framework-cheatsheet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my cheatsheet for using Microsoft's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET_Entity_Framework"&gt;Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;

I think most people who use Siri would agree, but "searching" is only one thing that Siri does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't use Siri much for general question-asking. ("Siri, is it raining?") Instead, I use Siri as a quick way to perform operations on my phone. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Add eggs to my groceries list"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Text my wife I'm on my way home."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"What is 345 times 843?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Set timer for five minutes."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Set alarm for 6 AM"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"When I get home, remind me to take the trash out."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Give me directions to Mall of Georgia."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siri works almost perfectly for these types of requests. I can do all of these things without unlocking my phone, typing anything, or navigating through user interfaces, saving time and minimizing interruption of whatever I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a period a few months ago when Siri was offline/unavailable a lot, but it is pretty reliable now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple hasn't done a good job in educating people about Siri's capabilities. Anyone who tries to do what the celebrities do in the TV commercials will be disappointed. Instead, I'd recommend reading something like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Talking-Siri-Intelligent-Assistant-ebook/dp/B007KORAIE/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1341583494"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talking to Siri: Learning the Language of Apple's Intelligent Assistant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which can give you all the necessary instructions and tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siri is far from perfect, but it is a really nice feature, and every other phone and computer maker is adding similar features. I'd recommend learning how to use the features effectively, rather than dismissing them due to their imperfections and limitations. Or you can just keep typing everything, like an old person.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="siri"></category></entry><entry><title>HTML Man pages</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/html-man-pages.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-25T02:31:25-04:00</published><updated>2012-06-25T02:31:25-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2012-06-25:/html-man-pages.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've used UNIX-based systems, you're probably aware of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page"&gt;man pages&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;As a tribute, here is my own "interview" for The Setup, using the standard four questions.  I don't expect anyone to find this interesting, but writing it up helps me think about what I'm using and why, and it will come in handy the next time I have to set up a new computer.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who are you, and what do you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Kris Johnson.  I &lt;a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/kristopherjohnson"&gt;develop software&lt;/a&gt; for Windows, UNIX, iOS, and Android.  I currently work as an independent contractor.  I work from home most of the time, but travel to clients' facilities as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What hardware are you using?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a late-2011 15-inch &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, with 16 GB RAM and a 750 GB hard drive. I use a &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/"&gt;Magic Trackpad&lt;/a&gt;.  In my home office, I have a 24-inch monitor and a &lt;a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional-for-mac/"&gt;Das Keyboard for Mac&lt;/a&gt;. On the road, I carry an &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC184LL/B"&gt;Apple Wireless Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an iPhone 4S and a third-generation wi-fi-only iPad.  I sometimes use an &lt;a href="http://adonit.net/product/jot/"&gt;Adonit Jot&lt;/a&gt; stylus with the iPad. I tether my iPad to the phone when necessary, but it is rare that I am using my iPad somewhere that doesn't have wi-fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For testing iOS apps, I have my old iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, 4th-generation iPod Touch, and original iPad. For testing Android apps, I have a Samsung Galaxy S Captivate phone and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find external conversations and music to be very distracting, so when I'm working I usually wear some &lt;a href="http://www.hearos.com/ear-plug-hearos"&gt;Hearos earplugs&lt;/a&gt; or sound-isolating earphones playing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise#Pink_noise"&gt;pink noise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bed at night, I read on a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_Fire"&gt;Kindle Fire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Targus computer bag that I lug everything around in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a Saeco super-automatic espresso machine. I try to limit myself to ten shots of espresso per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And what software?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my most-useful Mac OS X applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/"&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt; for iOS development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html"&gt;ADT Plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Android development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/a&gt; for web development and general text editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/"&gt;Parallels Desktop&lt;/a&gt; for running Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://kapeli.com/dash/"&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt; for developer reference documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/"&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; for git (but I tend to use the git command-line tools more often than this app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; for quick launching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://adium.im/"&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt; for chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; for web browsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/"&gt;Soulver&lt;/a&gt; for calculations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/"&gt;Pages&lt;/a&gt; for word processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Office for documents that I have to share with non-Mac people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/"&gt;nvALT&lt;/a&gt; for personal notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://manytricks.com/moom/"&gt;Moom&lt;/a&gt; for window management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/"&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php"&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt; for automatically clearing out my Downloads folder once in a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my most-used Windows applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio 2010 Professional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; (yes, it's cross-platform)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/"&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt; for Telnet/SSH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; for network-related code debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/download/"&gt;AutoHotKey&lt;/a&gt; to remap Windows keys and mouse gestures to work more like Mac OS X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburn/"&gt;Zenburn&lt;/a&gt; color scheme and &lt;a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/"&gt;DejaVu Sans Mono&lt;/a&gt; font in all my source-code editors and terminal windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://agilebits.com/downloads"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; installed everywhere I can install them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write everything in &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; format when I can, because so many of the tools I use support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog and other webby things are hosted on an &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Amazon EC2&lt;/a&gt; micro instance running Ubuntu. I put as much of my code as I can on &lt;a href="http://www.github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bitbucket.org"&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt; so that I don't have to worry about getting to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What would be your dream setup?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to have one of the new MacBook Pros with Retina display, but I need to wait until I can afford to buy an SSD that is large enough to hold Mac OS X and all my Windows virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to have a desk that can automatically move between standing and sitting height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to have my own helicopter for commuting between my home and clients' facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

It has me reminiscing about what the computer programming profession was like before the Internet.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
I had used the Internet in college. However, back then we didn't have web browsers. We had &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol"&gt;FTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)"&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet"&gt;Usenet newsgroups&lt;/a&gt;. So all that I really did with the Internet was download some software and engage in stupid arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then the only way to be on the Internet was to be at a university or working for a company that did work for the Department of Defense. So when I graduated, that was the end of the Internet for me, until a few years later when &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEnie"&gt;GEnie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe"&gt;CompuServe&lt;/a&gt;,) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL"&gt;America Online&lt;/a&gt; started provding Internet access to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a programmer's life was like back then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job search consisted of looking at classified ads in newspapers. I'd send a printed resum&amp;eacute; and cover letter to each local company that was hiring programmers.  The interviewing process was very similar to what it is today, except that there was no way to tell someone to look at your Stack Overflow or Github acttivity to get a feel for how well you could write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a couple of job offers, and took the one that seemed more interesting. Of course, back then it was hard to get a feel for how good an employer any company could be, due to lack of message boards or other ways to chat with current and former employees of that company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started work, I had a &lt;a href="http://terminals.classiccmp.org/wiki/index.php/DEC_VT340"&gt;DEC VT340&lt;/a&gt; display in my cubicle. This was connected via a local area network (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2"&gt;10BASE2&lt;/a&gt;, I believe) to the terminal server connected to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMScluster"&gt;VAXcluster&lt;/a&gt;.  The DEC VT340 was a character-based terminal, supporting 80x24 and 132x24 resolutions. It could even display multiple colors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrote software for the following platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunOS"&gt;SunOS&lt;/a&gt; (later to be renamed "SOLARIS")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T System V&lt;/a&gt; UNIX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS"&gt;VMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2"&gt;OS/2&lt;/a&gt; 1.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the lack of a notable operating system in that list?  We didn't touch Windows until NT 4.0 was released.  Our users had to use VT100-style terminals for most of our apps. A few "graphical" apps ran on OS/2 with a Matrox graphics card that displayed 1280x1024 images (and cost a few thousand dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE"&gt;Macintosh SE&lt;/a&gt; at home, but &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; in the professional world used Macs, and Apple was expected to go out of business any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything we wrote had to be portable between all those operating systems. Everything was written in C. Some of the compilers supported the new &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C"&gt;ANSI C&lt;/a&gt; standard, but some did not, so most of the code was old K&amp;amp;R-style C. I learned a lot about writing portable code back then, and today I still feel a shudder whenever I have to use a proprietary API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; as my editor back then. It was awesome because on a 80x24 display you could &lt;em&gt;display two files side by side&lt;/em&gt;, and you could show &lt;em&gt;a terminal window and debugger window at the same time&lt;/em&gt;. (I would never recommend that anyone learn Emacs today, but back then, it was the best way to work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full build of our application from scratch took almost 24 hours. Obviously, you can't get much done with a 24-hour build-and-run cycle, so we would coordinate among ourselves to make whatever changes were needed, then schedule a recompilation of the minimum set of source files, and if they all compiled then we would relink the application. Even this minimal effort often took almost an hour, so everyone was very careful about making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had done a little C++ in college, and was hoping to use that again, but the company had done a big project in C++, and had so many problems with the compilers that they swore never to use C++ again.  (We would eventually use C++ a few years later when the time came to develop Presentation Manager applications for OS/2.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Internet, "online documentation" meant &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page"&gt;man pages&lt;/a&gt;.  Try reading a few man pages on an 80x24 display, and imagine that being your only online source of operating system information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we also had complete sets of the hardcopy documentation. One entire wall of the office contained the then-current VMS documentation. Another wall contained the previous-version VMS documentation. A third wall had the UNIX documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, the O'Reilly books about UNIX utilities were the most valuable things you had in your cube. You could also rely on your memory, because as complex as these operating systems were for the time, their APIs only consisted of a few dozen functions.  It was actually possible to memorize the entire platform API (try that with Java or .NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivering a software release to a client meant sending them a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtape"&gt;DECtape&lt;/a&gt;, either through the mail, or when a fix was urgently needed, by overnight courier. Because remote access to the sites was often impossible, or impractical due to slow modem speeds, we'd often need to physically visit sites to install new software or upgrade existing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't have email. We wrote memos, and had a lot more meetings that people do these days. An administrative assistant took the mail cart around each day to deliver the memos and mail. We generated many, many binders full of technical documentation. Some of that documentation was created by technical writers using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect"&gt;WordPerfect&lt;/a&gt;, but a most of it was plain ASCII text and simple &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art"&gt;ASCII art&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, I knew everything, and I was going to change the world. It was a wonderful feeling. I consider myself fortunate to have learned programming before Windows and Java ruined everything. But now I have a computer in my pocket that is more powerful and more useful than the million-dollar mainframe I wrote code for back then, so I wouldn't want to go back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category></entry><entry><title>Want to Develop iOS Apps? Learn Objective-C.</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/want-develop-ios-apps-learn-objective-c.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-06T14:41:42-04:00</published><updated>2012-05-06T14:41:42-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2012-05-06:/want-develop-ios-apps-learn-objective-c.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an iOS software developer, I am often asked whether "we" (a team I'm working with, or someone I'm advising) should avoid using Objective-C and instead use a higher-level or easier-to-learn programming language.

&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an iOS software developer, I am often asked whether "we" (a team I'm working with, or someone I'm advising) should avoid using Objective-C and instead use a higher-level or easier-to-learn programming language. In general, my answer is "No". The rest of this post explains why.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of background: Apple provides a development tool called "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode"&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt;" which is what they want developers to use to write iOS apps. Programs are written using a programming language called "Objective-C", which enhances C with Smalltalk-style object-oriented message-passing features. Developers also use a tool called "Interface Builder" to visually lay out user-interface elements. Finally, there is a vast collection of libraries known as the "&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/cocoa-touch.html"&gt;Cocoa Touch frameworks&lt;/a&gt;" which provide the programming interfaces to all the cool stuff that iPhones and iPads can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many iOS developers enjoy the nature of Objective-C, many others think it is a terrible language for application development. Writing code in Objective-C seems very complicated to people accustomed to writing applications in C&amp;#x266f;, Java, Ruby, Python, Javascript, and other more modern languages. Many would-be iOS developers don't know C and don't want to learn it. Objective-C developers have to think too much about memory management and other low-level aspects of their applications. Apple is the only company that uses Objective-C, so those who would like to reuse code across different platforms are frustrated due to its non-portability. The Xcode environment has many detractors, and even its fans admit that its bugs and quirks can be maddening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to defend Objective-C or Xcode. Many iOS developers would like to use other programming languages and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternatives to Objective-C and Xcode can be grouped into two categories. One category is the set of tools that allow developers to write their apps in other programming languages, using some sort of bridge to the Cocoa Touch frameworks, which are then compiled down to native code just like Objective-C is. Examples of this category are &lt;a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch"&gt;MonoTouch&lt;/a&gt; (for C&amp;#x266f;) and &lt;a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/"&gt;RubyMotion&lt;/a&gt; (for Ruby).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other category is the set of tools that allow developers to use HTML/CSS/Javascript to write webapp-style code, which is then packaged as something that will run as a native app.  These tools provide some means to access the raw Cocoa Touch frameworks if desired, but the real purpose is to shield developers from them. Examples of these are &lt;a href="http://phonegap.com/"&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/"&gt;Titanium Appcelerator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most developers, my advice is to stay away from these things. Go ahead and evaluate them, and maybe one of them is a good fit for your particular set of circumstances, but if you don't know that you have a good reason to use them, just bite the bullet and learn Objective-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's why: Developing a good iOS app requires use of the Cocoa Touch frameworks. Learning how to use those frameworks is what is difficult about iOS development. Learning Objective-C should take a competent programmer only a day or two, but learning the frameworks is a never-ending struggle. Apple's documentation and samples for the frameworks use Objective-C. Most of the third-party libraries and other components you will want to use are in Objective-C. The smart people who answer iOS development questions in online forums use Objective-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you are using another programming language to interface with all this Objective-C stuff, you end up with these little walls you have to hop over a lot. I'd prefer not to build those walls. &lt;a href="http://merbist.com/2012/05/04/macruby-on-ios-rubymotion-review/"&gt;The RubyMotion review by Matt Aimonetti&lt;/a&gt; describes how difficult it can be, especially for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exception to this rule is if you can create a good webapp-style app using PhoneGap or Titanium Appcelerator. The big benefit of this approach is that you can reuse or share HTML/CSS/Javascript code across platforms, so when your iOS app is done you can release versions for Android, Windows Phone, and other platforms with a minimal amount of additional work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you take this approach, you will end up with a webappish app, not an app that takes advantage of what makes iOS special (or what makes any other platform special). Maybe that's the right solution for you, but you'll have to accept that some users will react by saying "Eww, this feels like a webapp".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Right Tool for the Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, it's a good idea to use whatever tools and APIs are officially supported by your vendor. If you are doing iOS development, that means you should use Objective-C and Xcode. If you are doing Android development, use Java and Eclipse with the Android Development Toolkit. If you are doing Windows development, use C&amp;#x266f; and Visual Studio. Going with other solutions might have benefits, but whenever you choose an unsupported development environment, you are taking a big risk.

&lt;p&gt;Using the right tool for the job is a good idea. Using anything other than Objective-C to develop iOS apps results in more work and more risk. Just go ahead and learn it.

Actually, I didn't get bored, I got &lt;em&gt;annoyed&lt;/em&gt; with it. At the time, I couldn't describe exactly what it was that was annoying me, but I felt that each SF novel I read was following a formula that had stopped entertaining me, and that SF had become a waste of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, I've started reading SF again. I've read new stories by new authors, and tried to catch up on some of the SF classics I should have read back in the 80's. A friend loaned me his copy of Robert Heinlein's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I looked forward to reading it, as I had heard it was one of the best SF novels ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated it. This novel reminded me of everything that made me stop reading science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of smart people do enjoy this book, so I spent some time thinking about what they see in it, and what it is that I find so repulsive.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
Similar to the distinction between &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction"&gt;"hard" and "soft" SF&lt;/a&gt;, I see a distinction between "cold" and "warm" SF. These are the attributes of "cold" SF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plot is a set of intellectual puzzles. There is one big overarching puzzle ("How do we destroy the alien fleet?", "How can we get back to Earth", "Where did this strange artifact come from?"), and a series of little puzzles that the characters have to solve before solving the big puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central characters exhibit no emotion. All behavior is logical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central characters have no goals other than solving the puzzles. The author may spend a whole chapter explaining how a character fixes the spaceship's FTL drive, but won't spend a paragraph telling us what that character's hopes or dreams are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characters don't have realistic conversations. They deliver lectures to one another. They may rarely express friendship and affection for one another, but those expressions are very formal and limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characters have no doubts or fears. (That wouldn't be logical.) They might make mistakes, but when they do it is due to lack of information, not poor judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no significant conflict between the main characters. They share the same goal, they cooperate easily, and they get along with one another. (Except when there is one character who secretly has another agenda. When the surprise is revealed, it is quickly dealt with.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical and moral questions have simple logical answers. If violence is necessary, it doesn't bother the characters. They kill for logical reasons, without hesitation or remorse. If a friend is lost, those remaining just move on after a quick tip-of-the-hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cold" SF is not necessarily bad. Stanley Kubrick's &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is a prime example of "cold", in which sterile environments and spare dialogue build tension. And I do like "cold" short stories, like Asimov's robot stories. I understand the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for me, "cold" long-form SF is usually unsatisfying. Since the characters don't act like real people, I don't care about them or whether they solve their puzzles, and I don't care to slog through long books about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So obviously, I enjoy "warm" SF more than "cold". I like characters with irrational desires, doubts, and fears. I like characters who screw up and have to live with the consequences. I like characters who make me laugh. I like characters who disagree with one another. I like characters who can't find all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I didn't enjoy reading &lt;em&gt;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&lt;/em&gt;, it did teach me something about myself. In that way, it was a good read.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sf"></category><category term="selfindulgence"></category><category term="rant"></category><category term="books"></category></entry><entry><title>KJSimpleBinding</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/kjsimplebinding.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-22T10:15:47-04:00</published><updated>2012-03-22T10:15:47-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2012-03-22:/kjsimplebinding.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mac OS X provides a pretty nice &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UI_data_binding"&gt;data-binding&lt;/a&gt; technology for developers, called &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html"&gt;Cocoa bindings&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I have done just that.

However, it is not the best tool for every job. Sometimes you have to write code to dynamically create user interface elements or to move them around as the view is resized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do this, you find that iOS doesn't help you much beyond some rudimentary autoresizing options. While iOS 5 does provide some autolayout features, they are limited, and they don't help at all if you need to support earlier versions of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a need to do a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(page_layout)"&gt;grid-based layout&lt;/a&gt; in an iOS app. I hoped to find a grid-layout component like one would find in &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/GridLayout.html"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.grid.aspx"&gt;WPF&lt;/a&gt;, but there is no such thing built into iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also couldn't find any third-party implementations. I found a few posts and samples for making a grid-like &lt;code&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt;, but I wanted a way to lay out things in a grid in a plain-old &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to write my own grid-layout thingees for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are the &lt;code&gt;KJGridLayout&lt;/code&gt; class and the &lt;code&gt;KJGridLayoutView&lt;/code&gt; class, which you can find on &lt;a href="http://github.com/kristopherjohnson/KJGridLayout"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.

I'm a fast and accurate typist, compared to most programmers. I've always considered typing to be a basic skill that all programmers should take seriously. What goes on in your head is more important than how fast you can type, but the more efficient you are in getting your thoughts into the computer, the better you are going to be at your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been dismayed at one "feature" of my MacBook: to prevent accidental triggering of the Caps Lock key by incompetent typists, Apple makes it necessary to hold down the Caps Lock key for an extra fraction of a second. If you just tap it quickly, it does nothing. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1192 for Apple's explanation. They have also baked this behavior into some of their keyboards: see http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1578.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm sure that many people welcome this feature, I do not. I type quickly and confidently, and my fingers hit the Caps Lock key at the appropriate times without me consciously thinking about it. I hit and release it so quickly that my MacBook ignores it. So when I type "UNIX is awesome!", "Party in the USA!" or "New York, NY", I see "unix is awesome!", "Party in the usa!" or "New York, ny" on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no easy way to disable this feature. When I complain, most people respond "Big deal. We hardly ever use Caps Lock." Well, I do. I've been using it for 30 years, and it has always worked fine. Until Apple decided It Should Just Not Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I looked into what I could do.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
The short answer is "Nothing". I have found a few mentions of kernel extensions and keyboard driver hacks, but this behavior seems to be embedded so deeply within OS X that there is no safe and reliable way to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool kids all remap their Caps Lock key to work as the Control key. The reasoning is that programmers have to use the Control key a lot, and nobody has typed anything in all caps since 1968, so there is no need for a Caps Lock key. I have resisted doing any remapping of my keyboards, because I often have to use computers and keyboards that are not mine, and I didn't want to have to remember which keyboards are remapped and which are not. But since the Caps Lock key is useless to me, I decided to go ahead and give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easy to do on OS X: just go to &lt;em&gt;System Preferences&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Keyboard&lt;/em&gt; and click the &lt;em&gt;Modifier Keys...&lt;/em&gt; button, and then you can change the Caps Lock key to work as Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I don't have a Caps Lock key anymore, and I'd like to have one when I need to type "DANGER WILL ROBINSON! DANGER! DANGER! DANGER". Actually, joking aside, typing stuff in all caps comes up a lot in programming, and I've never understood why any programmers say they never need Caps Lock. Do they really hold down Shift while typing something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;int fd = creat(&amp;quot;file.dat&amp;quot;, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_DSYNC | O_RSYNC);
if (fd == -1) {
    if (errno == EEXIST) {
        /* ... */
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wanted to map some other key to Caps Lock for those times when I needed it. Some people swap their Caps Lock with Control, but I knew that wouldn't work for me: my fingers expect Control to be where it is, and I frequently use Control along with Command and/or Option, and hitting all those at once is awkward if the only Control key is where the Caps Lock key usually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted to do was set things up so that double-tapping the Shift key would toggle Caps Lock mode, as it does on the virtual keyboards on iOS devices. I couldn't find a way to do that. So I decided I'd like to be able to hit Fn+Tab to trigger Caps Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that can be done with the &lt;a href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/"&gt;KeyRemap4MacBook&lt;/a&gt; utility. It's a little hard to configure (especially if you aren't comfortable editing XML files), but I got it set up. If you want to play at home, here's what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install &lt;a href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/"&gt;KeyRemap4MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. You'll have to restart at the end of the installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;strong&gt;System Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;KeyRemap4MacBook&lt;/strong&gt; preference pane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;Misc &amp;amp; Uninstall&lt;/strong&gt; tab, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Open private.xml&lt;/strong&gt; button. This will open a Finder window in the folder where the &lt;code&gt;private.xml&lt;/code&gt; configuration file is located.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;private.xml&lt;/code&gt; in your favorite text editor (use TextEdit if you don't have a favorite text editor). It will be blank. Paste the following into it (which can also be found at https://gist.github.com/2002690 ):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&amp;lt;root&gt;
  &amp;lt;item&gt;
    &amp;lt;name&gt;Private Settings&amp;lt;/name&gt;

    &amp;lt;item&gt;
      &amp;lt;name&gt;Fn+Tab to CapsLock&amp;lt;/name&gt;
      &amp;lt;identifier&gt;private.fn_tab_to_capslock&amp;lt;/identifier&gt;
      &amp;lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::TAB, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK&amp;lt;/autogen&gt;
    &amp;lt;/item&gt;

  &amp;lt;/item&gt;
&amp;lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the file, then go back to the &lt;strong&gt;System Preferences -&amp;gt; KeyRemap4MacBook&lt;/strong&gt; preference pane and do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;Change Key&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;ReloadXML&lt;/strong&gt; button to load your configuration file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Private Settings&lt;/strong&gt; item should appear in the list in the preference pane. Expand the item, and check the &lt;strong&gt;Fn+Tab to CapsLock&lt;/strong&gt; box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you should be able to press Fn+Tab, and you'll see the Caps Lock key light up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try this setup for a while, but I suspect I won't get used to it. Maybe I'll have to tweak it more, or maybe I'll just give up and learn to slow down for the Caps Lock key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Code templates, key bindings, and other settings are saved per-workspace. They can be exported and imported into other workspaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android SDK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;code&gt;android update project --path .&lt;/code&gt; to prepare a directory for command-line builds. This will create &lt;code&gt;local.properties&lt;/code&gt;. To make a release build, do &lt;code&gt;ant all clean release&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html"&gt;App Signing&lt;/a&gt;. To share a &lt;code&gt;debug.keystore&lt;/code&gt; between developers, create it like this: &lt;code&gt;keytool -genkey -keypass android -keystore debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -validity 1000 -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility Library&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/compatibility-library.html"&gt;compatibility library&lt;/a&gt; is available to provide newer API features to older API levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Application Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/index.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Styles and Themes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application-specific styles are defined in XML files in the &lt;code&gt;res/values&lt;/code&gt; folder of the project. Syntax for style definitions is described here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/style-resource.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard Android style and theme definitions can be found in the &lt;code&gt;platforms/android-N/data/res/values&lt;/code&gt; folder in the Android SDK (where &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; is the platform version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All available style properties are listed here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All available styles are listed here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on Styles and Themes: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/themes.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools help generate assets for Android apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android Asset Studio: &lt;a href="http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/index.html"&gt;http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ActoinBar Style Generator: &lt;a href="http://actionbarstylegenerator.com/"&gt;http://actionbarstylegenerator.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android Holo Colors: &lt;a href="http://android-holo-colors.com"&gt;http://android-holo-colors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Activity Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities exist in one of three states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resumed (or Running): activity is in foreground and has user focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paused: another activity is in the foreground and has focus, but this activity is still visible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stopped: activity is completely obscured, but still maintains state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifecycle callbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;onCreate()&lt;/code&gt; - followed by &lt;code&gt;onStart()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;onRestart()&lt;/code&gt; - followed by &lt;code&gt;onStart()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;onStart()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;onResume()&lt;/code&gt; - followed by &lt;code&gt;onPause()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;onPause()&lt;/code&gt; - followed by &lt;code&gt;onResume()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;onStop()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;onStop()&lt;/code&gt; - followed by &lt;code&gt;onDestroy()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;onRestart()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;onDestroy()&lt;/code&gt; - final call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity is killable after &lt;code&gt;onPause()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;onStop()&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;onDestroy()&lt;/code&gt;. (Only &lt;code&gt;onPause()&lt;/code&gt; is "guaranteed" to be called.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Activity A starts Activity B:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A's &lt;code&gt;onPause()&lt;/code&gt; method executes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B's &lt;code&gt;onCreate()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;onStart()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;onResume()&lt;/code&gt; methods execute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If A is no longer visible, its &lt;code&gt;onStop()&lt;/code&gt; method executes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)&lt;/code&gt; will be called if an activity may be killed. If called, it will be called before &lt;code&gt;onStop()&lt;/code&gt;, but there are no guarantees about whether it will occur before or after &lt;code&gt;onPause()&lt;/code&gt;. Bundle will be passed to &lt;code&gt;onCreate(Bundle)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)&lt;/code&gt; if activity is recreated. By default, this mechanism saves/restores states of all views in the hierarchy, as long as each widget has an ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fragments and Loaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/fragments.html"&gt;Fragments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/loaders.html"&gt;Loaders&lt;/a&gt;. Also see http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/02/android-30-fragments-api.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compatibility library has support for fragments and loaders. Need to derive class from &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/FragmentActivity.html"&gt;FragmentActivity&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;code&gt;getSupportFragmentManager()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getSupportLoaderManager()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Menus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For basic implementation of menu triggered by MENU button or action bar, override &lt;code&gt;onCreateOptionsMenu()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onOptionsItemSelected()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change options menu after creation, override &lt;code&gt;onPrepareOptionsMenu()&lt;/code&gt;. On Android 3.0+, need to call &lt;code&gt;invalidateOptionsMenu()&lt;/code&gt; to force system to call &lt;code&gt;onPrepareOptionsMenu()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create context menu for a view, call &lt;code&gt;registerForContextMenu()&lt;/code&gt;, then implement &lt;code&gt;onCreateContextMenu()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onContextItemSelected()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More about menus here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/menus.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dialogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Override &lt;code&gt;onCreateDialog(int)&lt;/code&gt; and maybe &lt;code&gt;onPrepareDialog(int, Dialog)&lt;/code&gt;. Use the &lt;code&gt;AlertDialog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ProgressDialog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DatePickerDialog&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;TimePickerDialog&lt;/code&gt; classes, or create custom dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call &lt;code&gt;showDialog(int)&lt;/code&gt; to display the dialog. Call Dialog's &lt;code&gt;dismiss()&lt;/code&gt; or activity's &lt;code&gt;dismissDialog(int)&lt;/code&gt; to close it. Implement &lt;code&gt;DialogInterface.OnDismissListener&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;DialogInterface.OnCancelListener&lt;/code&gt; for notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider using new fragments API for dialogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ListView and ListActivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ListActivity.html"&gt;ListActivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html"&gt;ListView&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListAdapter.html"&gt;ListAdapter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-listview.html"&gt;Hello, ListView tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.layout.html"&gt;R.layout&lt;/a&gt; lists standard list item layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-merge"&gt;CWAC MergeAdapter&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to bind list items to different kinds of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call adapter's &lt;code&gt;notifyDataSetChanged()&lt;/code&gt; method when data changes, to force views and observers to update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tabs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-tabwidget.html"&gt;Tab Layout tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that newer Android apps should use the ActionBar API rather than old-style tabs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="cheatsheet"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Measuring Elapsed Time in C# Methods</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/measuring-elapsed-time-c-methods.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-10T01:12:02-05:00</published><updated>2012-02-10T01:12:02-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2012-02-10:/measuring-elapsed-time-c-methods.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When determining why some damned thing in my .NET programs is taking so damned long, it is useful to be able to look at the elapsed time for various sections of code.

The straightforward way to do this is to create an instance of &lt;code&gt;System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch&lt;/code&gt;, start it, do the thing, then stop the &lt;code&gt;Stopwatch&lt;/code&gt; and print out the elapsed time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets tedious to keep adding those &lt;code&gt;var stopwatch = new Stopwatch(); stopwatch.Start();&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stopwatch.Stop(); Print(stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);&lt;/code&gt; lines all over the place, and it also makes the code less readable, so I made a little class to simplify things.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
Here is the class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;public static class Timed
{
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    /// Execute action then invoke reporting action with elapsed time
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;timedAction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;action to be executed and elapsed time measured&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;reportAction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;action to be executed with the elapsed number of milliseconds passed as a parameter&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;returns&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;number of milliseconds elapsed during timedAction&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/returns&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    public static long Execute(Action timedAction, Action&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;long&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; reportAction)
    {
        var stopwatch = new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch();

        stopwatch.Start();
        timedAction();
        stopwatch.Stop();

        var elapsedMilliseconds = stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds;

        if (reportAction != null)
        {
            reportAction(elapsedMilliseconds);
        }

        return elapsedMilliseconds;
    }

    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    /// Invoke specified action and return number of milliseconds elapsed
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;timedAction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;timed action to be executed&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    /// &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;returns&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;number of milliseconds elapsed&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/returns&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    public static long Execute(Action timedAction)
    {
        return Timed.Execute(timedAction, null);
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if one wanted to measure the time used by the loop in this method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;public void BlurpAllFrables()
{
    foreach (var frable in GetFrables())
        frable.Blurp();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;one could do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;public void BlurpAllFrables()
{
    Timed.Execute(() =&amp;gt;
    {
        foreach (var frable in GetFrables())
            frable.Blurp();
    },
    (long millis) =&amp;gt;
    {
        Trace.WriteLine(String.Format(&amp;quot;Blurping frables took {0} ms&amp;quot;, millis.ToString()));
    });
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or one could do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;public void BlurpAllFrables()
{
    var millis = Timed.Execute(() =&amp;gt;
    {
        foreach (var frable in GetFrables())
            frable.Blurp();
    });

    Trace.WriteLine(String.Format(&amp;quot;Blurping frables took {0} ms&amp;quot;, millis.ToString()));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Or one could use an actual profiler.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="codesnippet"></category><category term="c#"></category><category term=".NET"></category></entry><entry><title>45</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/45.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-17T02:06:22-05:00</published><updated>2012-01-17T02:06:22-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2012-01-17:/45.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's another one of those "5" years.

&lt;p&gt;My brother announced that he and his wife were getting a divorce. Again, not happy news, but we have to accept it. The end-of-year family get-togethers have seemed incomplete without my sister-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even with those events, this year has been a pretty good one for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally, things have been better than usual. I developed Real Professional mobile apps for &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/udot-traffic/id477093147?mt=8"&gt;iPhone/iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.transcore.android.commuterLink&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;. These apps have over 30,000 users, and they have been well received. Most applications I've developed during my career had only a few dozen users, so this larger reach gives me a sense that I can have some sort of effect on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've wanted to make iPhone and iPad software since I was 12 years old. Unfortunately, iPhones and iPads didn't exist back then. I'm glad that the devices are finally here, and that they pay me to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One resolution I've made for the coming year is to spend at least one hour per day working on personal programming projects. I gave up programming "for fun" a few years ago when work was burning me out, but now my interest has been rekindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started meditating almost-daily about 12 months ago. For this, I credit 5by5's &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/person/dan-benjamin"&gt;Dan Benjamin&lt;/a&gt;, who mentioned his &lt;a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/an-introduction-to-mindfulness-meditation/"&gt;meditation practice&lt;/a&gt; on several podcasts. I'm no zen master, but I do feel less stress and it's easier to ignore all the little problems in my life. I only have a mental breakdown two or three times a day now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optometrist prescribed progressive lenses for me this year. I don't like having old-people glasses, but I'm glad that my corrected eyesight is better. I wish I'd gotten these years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life with my wife and stepson keeps getting better. Bailey has matured and calmed down a lot over the past year&amp;mdash;we actually see him smile once in a while! Pebble hasn't had to spend any time in the hospital this year, which makes us both feel a lot better. Our five dogs are all healthy and happy. Our little cabin in the foothills is still the nicest place I've ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like getting older, but as long as the years keep getting better, I won't complain about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category><category term="birthday"></category></entry><entry><title>Creating .NET Remoting IPC Channels</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/creating-net-remoting-ipc-channels.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-14T14:36:55-05:00</published><updated>2011-12-14T14:36:55-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-12-14:/creating-net-remoting-ipc-channels.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet another C# code snippet.

I'm developing a service and an accompanying UI that always run on the same physical box, and it was suggested that I implement the communication between them using .NET Remoting and the &lt;em&gt;IPC&lt;/em&gt; channel type, which is a supposedly-easy way to get processes on the same machine to talk to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wasn't easy, because if you simply create and register an &lt;code&gt;IpcChannel&lt;/code&gt; with default parameters, you get security-related exceptions when you try to do anything with it.  You have to delve through documentation and online forums to figure out what underdocumented magic is required to get the stuff to actually work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two obstacles I had to overcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, user-defined types will not be deserialized, to prevent deserialization-based attacks by malicious clients. To disable this "feature", one must set the &lt;code&gt;TypeFilterLevel&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Full&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My service runs as the LocalSystem user, whereas the client application runs in the logged-in user's security context. By default, the user's account would not be able open the IPC port that the service creates. The fix to this is to set the channel's &lt;code&gt;authorizedGroup&lt;/code&gt; to the name of a user group that is allowed to open the port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as usual, the resulting code looks simple, but it took a couple of hours to figure out what had to be written.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
Here's the code, which is intended to work on .NET Framework 2.0 and higher on Windows XP and newer operating systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/3047562.js?file=IpcRemotingUtil.cs"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the server side, I use it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;var channel = IpcRemotingUtil.CreateIpcChannel(MyServer.IpcPortName);
ChannelServices.RegisterChannel(channel, true);

var entry = new WellKnownServiceTypeEntry(
    typeof(MyRemoteObject),
    &amp;quot;MyRemoteObject.rem&amp;quot;,
    WellKnownObjectMode.Singleton);
RemotingConfiguration.RegisterWellKnownServiceType(entry);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And on the client side, I use it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;var channel = IpcRemotingUtil.CreateIpcChannelWithUniquePortName();
ChannelServices.RegisterChannel(channel, true);

var objectUri = String.Format(&amp;quot;ipc://{0}/MyRemoteObject.rem&amp;quot;,
    MyServer.IpcPortName);
var remoteObject = (MyRemoteObject)Activator.GetObject(
    typeof(MyRemoteObject), objectUri);
try
{
    remoteObject.FooBarAndBaz();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // aaaiiiyyyeee
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that both sides use &lt;code&gt;IpcChannel&lt;/code&gt; so that the server can invoke callbacks in the client.  If you don't need callbacks, you could use &lt;code&gt;IpcServerChannel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IpcClientChannel&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;IpcChannel&lt;/code&gt;.  If you do that, you need to make sure you set the &lt;code&gt;TypeFilterLevel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;authorizedGroup&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;IpcServerChannel&lt;/code&gt; as is done above for the &lt;code&gt;IpcChannel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="remoting"></category><category term=".NET"></category></entry><entry><title>Configuring WebDAV and Digest Authentication for Ubuntu</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/configuring-webdav-and-digest-authentication-ubuntu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-08T22:42:40-05:00</published><updated>2011-12-08T22:42:40-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-12-08:/configuring-webdav-and-digest-authentication-ubuntu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm looking at using &lt;a href="http://wpkg.org/"&gt;WPKG&lt;/a&gt; as a mechanism for distributing software updates to client workstations.

WPKG appears to be a pretty nice system, but it has one big downside: one has to set up a WebDAV-enabled server if the updates are to be pulled from the Internet instead of from a local shared directory.  So I've spent a few hours learning the intricacies of  setting up WebDAV on &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2010/11/12/setting-drupal-ubuntu-1010-ec2"&gt;my Ubuntu-based Internet server&lt;/a&gt; and accessing it from Windows machines.  Here's what I learned.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
I started by following the steps here: &lt;a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-set-up-webdav-with-apache2-on-ubuntu-9.04"&gt;How To Set Up WebDAV With Apache2 On Ubuntu 9.04&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seemed to get me working: I could access the &lt;code&gt;webdav&lt;/code&gt; directory without any problem using web browsers, Mac OS X, or Linux.  However, it didn't work when I tried to connect from Windows, which is unfortunate, because Windows is the one platform where I need it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours of Googling and hair-pulling, I discovered that the problem is that Windows Vista and Windows 7 don't support Basic HTTP authentication for WebDAV.  One needs to either use Digest authentication, or &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841215"&gt;make registry changes&lt;/a&gt; to enable Basic authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to force registry changes on all the client machines, and Digest authentication is The Right Thing anyway, so I changed my Apache configuration to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the new lines that ended up in my &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-available/default&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;/var/www/webdav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            Options Indexes MultiViews
            AllowOverride None
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    Alias /webdav /var/www/webdav

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;/webdav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            DAV On
            AuthType Digest
            AuthName &amp;quot;webdav&amp;quot;
            AuthDigestDomain /webdav/
            AuthDigestProvider file
            AuthUserFile /var/www/webdav/.digest_passwd.dav
            Require valid-user
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I had to enable the &lt;code&gt;auth_digest&lt;/code&gt; module:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo a2enmod auth_digest
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I had to create the digest authentication file, adding the user &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo htdigest -c /var/www/webdav/.digest_passwd.dav webdav test
sudo chown root:www-data /var/www/webdav/.digest_passwd.dav
sudo chmod 640 /var/www/webdav/.digest_passwd.dav
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With all those changes made, I did this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And then I verified that I could do the following from my Windows box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;net use \\example.com\webdav MYPASSWORD /user:test
dir \\example.com\webdav
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With that done, I then set up WPKG and everything was easy and smooth!&lt;/p&gt;

I've asked a lot of questions there, and answered a lot of questions there, and I've found the answers to lots and lots of questions that someone else has already asked. Participating in Stack Overflow has been great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there have been a few cases where I've asked a question in this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need some code that will [...].  Can someone point me to some existing code that does this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I have received responses and comments like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren't here to do your homework for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't expect help without doing a little bit of work on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mean "Plez sir send me the codez?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't understand why my questions provoke these responses.  It is possible that I am asking the question in a way that the readers interpret as demanding or rude.  But I also wonder if some people think that looking for existing code to solve a problem is a dishonorable thing to do, and Real Programmers write everything they need from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I had asked this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am new to C.  I need to format some printed output in my C program.  What's the easiest way to do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope someone would respond with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a standard function called "printf()" that will do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can't you just figure out how to write your own formatting function  It's the best way to learn C.  Or are you just too lazy to spend time learning things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appropriate reuse of already written and debugged code is the mark of a professional, and time spent in research of existing implementations of algorithms you need is time well invested.  If you want to write the millionth from-scratch implementation of Quicksort in your favorite programming language, go right ahead, but those of us who have real work to do are going to look for a library or a code snippet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="rant"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Steve Jobs</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/steve-jobs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-10T14:08:24-04:00</published><updated>2011-10-10T14:08:24-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-10-10:/steve-jobs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's OK to have heroes, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't think I had any heroes, but when Steve&amp;nbsp;Jobs passed away last week, it hit me harder than expected. I didn't cry, I didn't go into a funk, but I was sad and felt like I'd lost something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We idealize our heroes. We ignore their flaws and the fact that they are just regular people, and instead create simple character sketches based on a few noble aspects of their personalities and deeds. For example, Albert&amp;nbsp;Einstein was a very smart, yet very warm and kind person, Abraham&amp;nbsp;Lincoln freed the slaves, and Thomas&amp;nbsp;Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. We reduce a hero to a simple sentence, knowing that it is an incomplete picture, but focusing on what it is that makes the hero important to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs inspired people to make awesome things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me he represents the drive to make things better. But "better" wasn't good enough; he insisted that they be &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;. Sure, he exaggerated the greatness of Apple's products, and didn't give credit to the sources of many of the ideas that went into those products, but he did everything he could to make them the best they could be, and to give them a little bit of magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn't make things easy for software developers, or for hardware engineers, or for component manufacturers, or for IT managers. He simply did not care about their problems. His goal was to bring the amazing power of computers to normal people. He wanted normal people to have machines that they could use to create things and to enjoy themselves, without expecting them to become programmers and hardware techs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of business-type people wish that they were Steve&amp;nbsp;Jobs. Not me. I would not have wanted to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; Steve&amp;nbsp;Jobs, but I would have loved to &lt;em&gt;work for&lt;/em&gt; Steve Jobs. Even if I was the recipient of his famously colorful criticism, I'd know that I was getting advice from someone who expected me to do great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed out on the Apple II era (having an Atari 800 instead), so my first Apple product was a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE"&gt;Macintosh SE&lt;/a&gt;. I loved that cute, beautiful little computer. I learned Pascal, C, and Motorola 68000 assembly programming on that computer. I drew pictures, I played games, I stuck it in the back seat of my car when going from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know what it is about that Mac that really sticks out in my memory? If you opened the case, instead of finding just metal and wires, you found engraved signatures of Steve&amp;nbsp;Jobs and other members of the Macintosh team. They had created something special, and they were very proud of their work. That inspired me to be proud of the things I make, and to make them as beautiful and magical as I am able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I forget to do those things. I need Steve Jobs around to occasionally remind me.&lt;/p&gt;

It's important to understand the user-interface conventions and user expectations for whatever platform you are developing for, and I figured that the only way to learn those things would be to take the plunge and immerse myself in Android for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a self-indulgent review of what I've found. If you are an Android fan, you will probably summarize it as "Surprise! Apple fanboy doesn't like Android," and you can just stop reading here.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll quickly run down my background and biases, so people can understand some of my expectations and reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my first Apple computer, a Macintosh SE, in 1987. I immediately felt that Apple understood how computers should look and work. My enthusiasm for Mac&amp;nbsp;OS waned in the late 1990's as Apple stuck with their rickety tinkertoy OS, and I became a GNU/Linux user for a few years. I bought an iMac&amp;nbsp;G5 in 2004 and my enthusiasm for the Apple way was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while my personal computers have mostly been Macs, 90% of my income for the past 19 years has come from developing Windows applications, and most of the rest has come from developing UNIX applications, so I'm not ignorant of how other systems work. For what it's worth, I think Windows 7 is about even with Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X 10.6 and 10.7 in terms of providing a good user experience. I stick with Macs because the hardware looks and feels better than the low-margin Wintel hardware that's on the market, and I don't mind paying more for something nice. I also like having a home computer that is nothing like my work computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've long been a fan of mobile computing. When I was a kid, I wanted an iPad, but nobody made an iPad until 2010. So in the meantime I've had an Apple&amp;nbsp;Newton, a few Palm&amp;nbsp;OS devices, a few Windows&amp;nbsp;CE/Pocket&amp;nbsp;PC/Windows&amp;nbsp;Mobile devices, and a couple of never-officially-released products (anybody remember the &lt;a href="http://tuxmobil.org/pda_linux_agenda.html"&gt;Agenda VR&lt;/a&gt;?). The iPhone was the first pocket-sized computer that did not completely suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am a fan of Apple's products, I don't like many of its policies toward consumers and developers, and I've wished for high-quality alternatives. I &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/11/19/switching-away-apple"&gt;looked at Android phones back in 2009&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that I'd like them enough to switch away from Apple's ecosystem. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/11/25/android-maybe-not"&gt;I was disappointed&lt;/a&gt; with the quality of Android phones and software, and it seemed clear to me that nobody was going to get rich developing software for a system that was marketed as a low-cost alternative to Apple's products. iPhone users are willing to pay for software, and Android users expect everything to be free, so it seemed obvious that if I wanted to make a living as a mobile-software developer, the iPhone market was the place to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing some iOS development, and I am now involved in porting iOS apps over to Android. As stated above, I think it's important that developers and designers deeply understand the conventions of the platforms they are developing for, and so I decided to buy an Android phone and put my iPhone away for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two primary criteria for choosing an Android phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted a "typical" Android phone. That is, I wanted one with display resolution, CPU speed, RAM, and features that would be close to what a majority of Android users would be using. So I didn't want the newest, most feature-packed phone, nor an old clunker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted a phone that would work on the AT&amp;amp;T network, so that I could just swap the SIM from my iPhone into it, rather than paying for another data plan or relying on wi-fi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that I bought a used Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S) via eBay. The Galaxy S is last year's model, but so is the iPhone&amp;nbsp;4, so I think it's fair to compare them. I know there are better Android phones out there, so please don't write me to tell me that your Nexus S or Atrix have none of the problems I mention in this review. I don't care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I like about the Captivate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The display is bright and crisp (not as nice as the iPhone 4 retina display, but pretty close).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The built-in speaker seems to be a little bit louder than the iPhone's. (I often listen to podcasts using the built-in speaker, and the iPhone's low volume has always bugged me.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't had a dropped call yet. (But I only have about two phone calls per week, so the sample is small.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I don't like about the Captivate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's too big, and the buttons are awkwardly placed. I'm sure some people like the large display size, but I find it difficult to hold it and operate it with one hand. Even with two hands, it doesn't feel right. (Your hands may vary.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's hard to tell which way is up. The iPhone has this problem too, but the big home button on the iPhone is easier to find when it's in your pocket or when it's dark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It feels plasticky and flimsy. I have dropped it a couple of times, and it didn't break, so It's not fragile, but it does feel like a kid's toy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is loaded with a bunch of AT&amp;amp;T crapware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has disabled installation of apps from "unknown sources", so the Android Market is the only place one can get apps. One can't get apps from the Amazon Appstore for Android or from developers who post free apps online. (There are various workarounds for this, but it's annoying.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hardware buttons (Menu, Home, Back, and Search) are not actual buttons, but are just little touch-sensitive areas at the bottom of the phone's case. I'd prefer something I can feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery life is terrible. If I just leave it in my pocket all day, then it's fine, but if I use it as often as I use my iPhone, I have to recharge it a couple of times per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have liked to try an Android tablet as well, but the app I'm porting is a phone app, not a tablet app, so I couldn't justify the purchase. Also, I keep hearing that &lt;em&gt;next year's&lt;/em&gt; Android tablets will be really awesome, so I'll keep waiting until that year comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to have to say what every other iPhone user says about Android, but here it is anyway: Android software is not as attractive and does not work as smoothly as iPhone software does. This is true both of built-in applications and third-party applications. Of course, the best Android apps look better than the worst iPhone apps, but as a rule, Android just isn't as good in the UI department. Default fonts look terrible, and are often way too big or way too small. Scrolling isn't smooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of using Remote Desktop Connection or VNC to access a remote computer. Everything works, but there's always a slight delay and loss of resolution that takes away the illusion of direct manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who develops both iOS and Android software, I can understand why this happens. Almost by default, iOS apps look nice. If you just throw a few of the standard UI gizmos into an app, without any additional customization or tweaking, the app will look pretty good. In contrast, Android's standard UI gizmos do not look good. Any really nice Android app you see probably has a lot of highly customized UI code. And if you do get it to look good on one model of Android phone, chances are that it will not look as good on all the other models of phone due to differences in screen sizes, resolutions, aspect ratios, graphics chipset, color schemes, fonts, etc., etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text editing experience is really bad. Unlike iOS, there is no magnifying loupe that appears when you want to finely position the cursor, so trying to place the cursor can be frustrating. Copy/paste is awkward. Many text-editing apps don't have an Undo feature. ("Who the hell does a lot of text editing on their phone," you ask? I do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things I really like about Android:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative input methods are welcome. The Swype keyboard is awesome. I really wish Apple would license this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home-screen widgets are cool. (On the other hand, Live Wallpapers are a demo that got out of hand.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notifications system is nice. (Apple will be providing a similar feature in iOS 5.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't really needed "true multitasking", but it is nice that all Android apps are capable of downloading updated content in the background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Maps navigation is nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about how horrible the Android&amp;nbsp;Market is in comparison to the App&amp;nbsp;Store, but I didn't find it to be a problem. Yes, there is a lot of crap in there, and it's frustrating when someone tells you "You need application X", and you search for "Application X" in the Market, and there are 20 matches. However, the App Store has a lot of crap in it too, and everyone knows that the way to find good software is by word of mouth and reviews from trusted sources, not by searching the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I easily found Android replacements for most of the iOS apps I depend upon. The only exception is the Omni Group's OmniFocus app, which is not available for Android. Fortunately, I can still run OmniFocus on my iPad and MacBook, so missing it on my phone is an annoyance rather then a deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While choice is good, it also has its downsides. Out of the box, my Captivate had five or six different apps that could play music, and I didn't know which one I should use. I'd prefer that there be exactly one standard built-in music player, or SMS app, or app launcher. It's great to have alternatives, but don't force a new user to make choices that they are unqualified to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iTunes is one of the worst applications in the world, but I do like that there is a standard way to sync an iOS device with my laptop. I miss that with Android. (Yes, I know about DoubleTwist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't rooted the phone. I also haven't jailbroken my iPhone. Ten years ago when I was trying out a new Linux distro every week, I would have loved the chance to try a bunch of different ROMs and OS customizations in my phone. Nowadays, I just don't have time for that. If the product isn't useful out of the box, I don't want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the Captivate as my primary phone for about five weeks. I was very happy to go back to the iPhone, but Android really isn't that bad. If Apple ever did anything that really pissed me off, switching to Android wouldn't be a great hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would still recommend an iPhone over an Android phone for a anyone who is not a geek. A big difference between being an iOS user and being an Android user is the degree of customization that is needed. You can buy an iPhone and use it as-is and be happy. In contrast, buying an Android phone is just a starting point&amp;mdash;you'll need to try a lot of different apps and tweaks before it works the way you want it to work. But if you are a geeky control-freak, then Android does offer more opportunity to get a phone that works exactly the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "open" nature of Android doesn't impress me. It's nice that one can download the source code and tweak it, but there are limits to the openness. Google doesn't release new versions of the software until it is shipping on new devices, and the whole development process is quite secretive. Handset manufacturers and carriers add their own restrictions on top of whatever Google provides, so even if Android were truly open, you're still at the mercy of the OEMs and carriers. I will never be able to get an OS upgrade for this year-old Captivate. I'd rather be subject to Apple's control than AT&amp;amp;T's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest beef with Android is that the whole thing just feels like a second-rate knockoff of the iPhone and iPad, and I've never liked using second-rate products. Palm and Microsoft have been trying some interesting things with their mobile platforms, but the folks at Google are simply engaged in mimicry. If Google can't innovate, then I hope they will steal some good ideas from those other platforms rather than just following in Apple's footsteps. If they are going to just keep copying Apple, I wish they'd do a better job of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with those who claim that Apple is evil and Google is good. Apple wants me to pay them lots of money for stuff I like. Google wants to give me a cheap operating system so that it can sell my data and attention to advertisers. I prefer Apple's offer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>KJMenuTableViewController - iOS Menus Made Easy</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/kjmenutableviewcontroller-ios-menus-made-easy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-31T21:22:17-04:00</published><updated>2011-07-31T21:22:17-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-07-31:/kjmenutableviewcontroller-ios-menus-made-easy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a new open-source library on Github for use by iOS developers: &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/KJMenuTableViewController"&gt;KJMenuTableViewController&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJMenuTableViewController is an Xcode project that contains set of classes that simplifies the
creation of "menus" in iOS applications using &lt;code&gt;UITableViewController&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

rows of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a new open-source library on Github for use by iOS developers: &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/KJMenuTableViewController"&gt;KJMenuTableViewController&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJMenuTableViewController is an Xcode project that contains set of classes that simplifies the
creation of "menus" in iOS applications using &lt;code&gt;UITableViewController&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;UITableViewController&lt;/code&gt; class is a generic mechanism for presenting a scrollable list of
rows of items.  It is powerful and extensible, but it can be a chore to present a simple
list of button-like objects that react when tapped.  One must provide implementations of several
methods of the &lt;code&gt;UITableViewDataSource&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UITableViewDelegate&lt;/code&gt; classes, each of which will
probably have a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement to handle each of the individual items. It's not difficult, but it is
tedious and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KJMenuTableViewController classes simplify this usage case.  One simply defines a subclass of
&lt;code&gt;KJMenuTableViewController&lt;/code&gt; and overrides the &lt;code&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/code&gt; method to create sections and row items.
&lt;code&gt;KJMenuTableViewController&lt;/code&gt; implements the table view delegate and data source methods to
appropriately display the sections and rows, and will take action when a row is tapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to be executed when an item is tapped are written as a block.
When the block is invoked, a &lt;code&gt;KJMenuItemInvocation&lt;/code&gt; structure is passed to it. This structure
contains pointers to the menu item, cell, and controller, so there is no reason for the block
to retain any of these objects itself.  (Beware of retain cycles if the block &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; reference
the menu item, cell, or controller.)
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, this will be a proper library, but right now the library is distributed as a demo
application that contains reusable classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make use of the reusable classes, copy the following source files from the demo project into
your own application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;KJMenuTableViewController.h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KJMenuTableViewController.m&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;KJMenuSection.h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KJMenuSection.m&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;KJMenuItem.h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KJMenuItem.m&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example snippet, the controller is a subclass of &lt;code&gt;KJMenuTableViewController&lt;/code&gt;, which is itself
a subclass of &lt;code&gt;UITableViewController&lt;/code&gt;.  In the &lt;code&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/code&gt; method, we add a first section with
two items, each of which displays its text in an alert box, and a second section that has
an item that pushes a new controller onto the navigation stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Add first section&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;KJMenuSection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KJMenuSection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;sectionWithHeaderTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;First Section&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;footerTitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;Select item above to display alert&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;addSection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;KJMenuItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;detailText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;This is the first item&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following features are planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add convenience methods to reduce the verbosity of setting up a menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it possible to add/remove menu items and change their attributes after menu has already been displayed. (As-is, you need to call the table view's &lt;code&gt;reloadData&lt;/code&gt; method if you change anything after &lt;code&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a mechanism so that only one item within a section has a checkmark, and when user selects another item the originally checked item is unchecked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide the ability to define a menu hierarchy that is handled by a single view controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for compilation with ARC enabled&lt;/li&gt;

Many apps use UIWebView to display web pages, online help, and other formatted content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the basic purpose of displaying HTML content, it works pretty well. However, as it appears to just be a wrapper around WebKit, one might be tempted to use it to try to implement a full-fledged web browser embedded in an application. &lt;em&gt;Don't do this!&lt;/em&gt; UIWebView has many limitations that make it unsuitable for this purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many commonly used JavaScript functions, such as &lt;code&gt;alert()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;window.open()&lt;/code&gt;, don't work at all or only work in limited ways in a UIWebView. So many of the web sites one would try to visit do not work in a UIWebView.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are limited hooks for customizing the behavior. There are a few delegate methods that notify your app when the web view starts loading or finishes loading, but you can't detect many of the events you'd really want to detect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UIWebView does not send the same browser identification info that Mobile Safari does, so some servers will treat it as an unknown browser and return limited content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some intrepid developers have found ingenious ways to work around some of these limitations. If you really want to try it, or if you are curious about what kinds of hackery are needed to use UIWebView as a web browser, check out these links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson I learned (after several hours of banging my head against the wall) is to pass web URLs over to Safari, rather than trying to display them in a UIWebView within my app. It's just not the right tool for this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2011/10/1):&lt;/strong&gt; My original post included this bullet point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't control authentication. UIWebView can open an HTTPS connection, but if the server-side certificate is self-signed, there is no way to get it to ignore the certificate, and so it just fails with an error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been informed that this is not entirely true. It is possible to somehow "preconnect" to the server with an NSConnection, deal with authentication, and then pass the credentials to the UIWebView. More information is available here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11573164/uiwebview-to-view-self-signed-websites-no-private-api-not-nsurlconnection-i/15074358#15074358&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ios"></category></entry><entry><title>My JavaScript Cheatsheet</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/my-javascript-cheatsheet.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-16T18:49:43-04:00</published><updated>2011-06-16T18:49:43-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-06-16:/my-javascript-cheatsheet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of times per year, I have to work on something that requires me to write some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gotchas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, use &lt;tt&gt;===&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;!==&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt; (which coerce arguments before comparison).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeric values are really IEEE floating-point, even when they look like integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;NaN&lt;/tt&gt; is not equal to itself. Use &lt;tt&gt;isNaN()&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semicolons are often optional, but interpreter may insert semicolons in unexpected places, so it is best to use semicolons and to put opening braces on the same line as the keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; declaration is missing, then a variable is global.  The scope of a &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; is the entire function in which it is declared (blocks do not create a new scope)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note difference between &lt;code&gt;substr(startIndex, charCount)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;substring(startIndex, endIndex)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid using &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; style comments, as regular expressions can contain similar character sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special Values and Constants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
null, undefined, false, true, NaN, Infinity
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Values that are considered to be "false" in conditionals: &lt;tt&gt;undefined, null, false, '', 0, NaN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;typeof obj&lt;/tt&gt; returns one of these values: &lt;tt&gt;'undefined', 'object', 'boolean', 'number', 'string', 'function'&lt;/tt&gt;. If the operand is an array or &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;, then the result is &lt;tt&gt;'object'&lt;/tt&gt;. If the operand is a regexp, the result may be either &lt;tt&gt;'object'&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;'function'&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standard Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

(268242) Pebble = 2005 JW1

Discovered 2005 May 4 by J. Bedient at Haleakala-Faulkes Telescope North.

Pebble Johnson (b. 19xx) is an innovative teacher of middle-school science and technology in Forsyth&amp;nbsp;County, Georgia. She uses astronomy to heighten interest and excitement in the physical sciences among her students.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The naming citation was published in MPC # 75106:
http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/2011/MPC_20110517.pdf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim also wrote the following in an email::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On May 4, 2005, I was observing with the 2.2m Faulkes Telescope-North on Haleakala, Maui.  While observing an asteroid on the NEO list, I observed another object in the background.  I performed astrometric observations on succeeding nights, and it received the provisional designation 2005&amp;nbsp;JW1. After following it for several years, its orbit has been accurately determined, and a few months ago it received its permanent designation, (268242). Under International Astronomical Union rules, this made it eligible for naming, and of the privileges of discovering a minor planet is naming it. A couple of months ago I submitted a name proposal to the IAU's Working Group for Small Body Nomenclature. Last week I was informed that the proposed name had been approved, and it is hereafter known as (268242)&amp;nbsp;Pebble, in honor of my good friend Dr.&amp;nbsp;Pebble&amp;nbsp;Johnson.

...

With the boom in minor planet discoveries in the last decade, due the advent of more sophisticated techniques, particularly larger telescopes and electronic detectors, naming citations are required to be considerably briefer than they once were allowed to be.  I really couldn't wax poetic about meeting Pebble ten years ago at Dr.&amp;nbsp;Karen&amp;nbsp;Meech's TOPS workshops in Hawaii, how she became a very dear friend, how I helped with her Ph.D thesis, and all the things, small and large, that go into forming a strong friendship. Placing her name in perpetuity on this small piece of solar system real estate is just an insignificant monument to a person with a very large heart.  I am honored to know her and to be able to make this gesture.

Programmers used to be the people who made software, but now a lot of other people are involved and claim credit for doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be an "architect" who guides the overall structure of the system. Often architects are former programmers, but they are far too important to write any code anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the "user experience" designer, who decides how the software should interact with its users. We used to call this "user interface design", but the UX people have redefined UI design to be the monkeywork of laying out controls and fields on forms.  Programmers can't be trusted with any important design decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the database administrator (DBA), who ensures that the programmers can't screw up the database schema. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are testers who tell the programmers whether they have done their jobs well enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these other people making the important decisions, what does a programmer do? Apparently programmers are glorified typists who transcribe specifications written by architects and UX designers into code that is verified by testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that's not how things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are teams and organizations that operate as described above, a lot of software is created by solitary programmers. The boss says "We need feature X," and a programmer then designs the user experience, updates the database schema, implements the new functionality, tests it, creates some new icons in Photoshop, adds a couple of pages to the user manual, and deploys the new software to the customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow a programmer is able to do this without help from all those people who are too important to write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those other people aren't useless. Software is certainly better when a good architect and good DBA maintain its structure, and when a talented UX designer makes it easy to use, and when good testers find the problems. But software is still made by programmers. Those other people don't make software&amp;mdash;they make wishes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="rant"></category></entry><entry><title>UTF-8</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/utf-8.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-06T14:48:23-04:00</published><updated>2011-04-06T14:48:23-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-04-06:/utf-8.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Matt Gallagher's &lt;a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/2011/04/user-interface-strings-in-cocoa.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CocoaWithLove+%28Cocoa+with+Love%29"&gt;"User interface strings in Cocoa"&lt;/a&gt; post is good for its overall purpose (telling people how to use &lt;code&gt;NSLocalizedString()&lt;/code&gt;), but I especially like this little embedded rant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quick swipe at almost everybody:&lt;/strong&gt; UTF-8 has been around since 1993 and Unicode 2.0 since 1996; if you have created any 8-bit character content since 1996 in anything other than UTF-8, then I hate you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I weep to think of the years of programmer time that are still wasted attempting to support non-Unicode formats without characters getting garbled because people are still creating content using ancient encodings without useful identifiers to indicate what nonsense encoding they're using (or worse, people creating content that explicitly uses the wrong encoding for an encoding-specific text field).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MacRoman? Atrocious. Big-5? I hope you want to see garbage output. Windows Latin? You suck. If you're creating new content using anything other than UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 then you should be forced to serve prison time with whatever idiot monkey decided that UTF-16 should be allowed little-endian and big-endian variants instead of a single authoritative encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

But if you go there to &lt;em&gt;buy something&lt;/em&gt;, the experience is confusing and humiliating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows how the process of buying something at a store is supposed to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You pick up the product(s) you want to buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You go to the end of the line at the checkout counter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it's your turn, you step up to the counter, transact your business, and go on your way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, here is how things work at the Apple Store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You pick up the product(s) you want to buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You stand there like a child who has lost his mommy, looking around for a friendly Apple associate who can help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the Apple associates are always busy helping other customers, you pick one and stand nearby, hoping to catch their attention when they are finished with the current customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, after helping the current customer, and maybe a few others who are also standing nearby, the associate asks how they can help you. You say you want to buy the things you have been holding. The associate says, "OK, I'll find someone to help you", and goes to look for one of the associates who has one of the magic credit-card-reading devices. You stand there looking lost again for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, a person with a magic device arrives to let you make your purchase. You fumble around, juggling products between your armpits, your crotch, and under your chin while you present each item for scanning.  Then you drop all the items while you dig out your wallet and credit card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you pick up the items you have dropped, the person swipes your card, then hands the little device back to you so you can check some boxes and sign your name.  Again, your items have to go into your armpits and onto the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you pick up your items again, the person goes to one corner of the store to get your printed receipt, then to the opposite corner of the store to get you a bag, then back to you. You help the associate put your items into the bag, and then you go on your way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't this all be easier if there was a checkout counter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the old ways are best.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category><category term="rant"></category></entry><entry><title>What I've Learned about iOS Development</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/what-ive-learned-about-ios-development.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-29T03:43:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-03-29T03:43:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-03-29:/what-ive-learned-about-ios-development.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been playing around with development for Mac OS X and iOS for a few years.

I've had a pretty good grasp of how Cocoa and UIKit worked, and I've written some simple apps, but for the past month I've been working on my first &lt;em&gt;Real iOS Application&lt;/em&gt;. I've had to solve some problems that were easily ignored when writing little apps for fun. What follows is a randomly ordered collection of some of the little techniques and tips I didn't know before, which may be useful for other Cocoa newbies.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
(More to come as I learn from more mistakes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NSDictionary is Incredibly Useful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long-time C++ programmer, whenever I have some sort of "object" with a bunch of "attributes" my instinct is to define a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; with a bunch of instance members. However, when using Objective-C, it is often easier and more useful to just throw all that stuff into an &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;NSMutableDictionary&lt;/code&gt;), for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't have to write code to save/load the data to/from files or &lt;code&gt;NSUserDefaults&lt;/code&gt;. As long as you can live with &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt;'s serialization format, you get persistence for free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many system classes and APIs already know how to work with dictionaries in interesting ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easier than defining an Objective-C class with properties. I know some Objective-C fans will disagree, but the &lt;code&gt;@property&lt;/code&gt; mechanism sucks. If you use an &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt;, then you can worry less about retain counts, &lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;/code&gt;, and other such things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It lets you write JavaScript-like or Python-like code, if you're into that sort of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of using &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt; is that it may be less efficient than using a custom class or a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. Use your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use NSValue to Box Pointers and Primitives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow the above advice about using &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt;, you'll run into a couple of wrinkles with using it as a general-purpose attribute container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keys and values have to be objects, not primitive types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The keys have to conform to the &lt;code&gt;NSCopying&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dictionary will retain values, which may introduce undesirable retain cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround for these issues is to use the &lt;code&gt;NSValue&lt;/code&gt; class and its subclasses, which can box most interesting values as objects that can be used as dictionary keys and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+[NSValue valueWithNonretainedObject:]&lt;/code&gt; is how you put objects into your collections without bumping the retain counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use objc_setAssociatedObject() and objc_getAssociatedObject() to Extend Unsubclassable Classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple frameworks contain some classes which cannot be subclassed (or cannot be &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; subclassed). If you just want to add some methods, then you can just define a category. In cases where you wish you could make a subclass to add a property or two, the workaround is to use &lt;code&gt;objc_setAssociatedObject()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;objc_getAssociatedObject()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't Support Old iOS Versions If You Don't Absolutely Have To&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm lucky in that I am developing an in-house application, not to be sold in the App Store, so I was able to decree that I would only support devices running iOS 4.2 and higher. This lets me take advantage of useful stuff that isn't available in pre-4.0 versions of iOS without cluttering the code with a lot of checks for feature support. It's nice to use blocks and regular expressions and other "new" iOS features without worrying about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I was developing for the App Store, I'd be tempted to require 4.0. People who haven't bought a new phone for a few years or who don't keep the OS up to date aren't going to pay for that app you're developing, so why do anything for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't Mix Objective-C and C++ Unnecessarily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, I was enamored with "Objective-C++", which is what you get when you change your &lt;code&gt;.m&lt;/code&gt; suffixes to &lt;code&gt;.mm&lt;/code&gt; and put C++ code into your Objective-C code. I thought this would be nifty, because I could use cool stuff from C++ (templates, typesafe container classes, smart pointers, RAII, ...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this for a while, but found that every time I decided to rewrite the C++ parts in plain-old-idiomatic Objective-C, the result was cleaner. So I don't do it any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think use of Objective-C++ is best limited to cases where you need to integrate some existing C++ code or libraries into your app, or when the guts of the app are all written in C++ and you need to interface with Objective-C-based UI classes. Don't use it to "improve" Objective-C. Objective-C is already a clumsy combination of C and Smalltalk. Dumping a third language into the mix doesn't make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use the Static Analyzer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective-C's manual memory management sucks, but I have yet to see a memory leak in my app that wasn't caught by the static analyzer. Run that Analyze command once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Don't Have to Use Interface Builder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time struggling with figuring out how to do complicated things in Interface Builder (like laying out a tab bar with a set of navigation controllers, each with toolbar items in their button bars and ...). After all, this is how one creates GUIs on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IB can be helpful, particularly when laying out a form-style view, but in many cases it is easier to create your views and hook up the events by writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying "Don't use Interface Builder," or "Interface Builder is for pussies." I'm just saying that if you know how to do it all in code, it will often be easier to get what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use UIWebView for Read-Only Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a view that simply displays information, it is often easier to write some simple HTML and CSS and display it in a UIWebView than it is to lay out a bunch of UIKit components. It also gives your non-Objective-C-knowing colleagues a way to help you out (but don't let them use Arial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Xcode 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, Xcode 4 is new (released just a few weeks ago), and lots of people are having problems with it. Those people recommend sticking with Xcode 3.x until the problems get worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into those problems, or if you are an old-timer who fears change, then by all means, use Xcode 3. But if you can use Xcode 4, then I heartily recommend it. The improved autocompletion alone is worth the risk of crashes and hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode 4 is pretty rough for a released Apple product, but iIt really isn't that bad. When I first started using, it seemed like it was crashing "all the time." I started recording each crash, and found that over the course of three weeks it crashed, on average, only about once per day. The crashes are annoying, but the effect on my productivity was neglible. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xcode documentation viewer sucks. Install &lt;a href="http://fileability.net/ingredients/"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. It's free. Assign a keyboard shortcut to the &lt;em&gt;Look up in Ingredients&lt;/em&gt; item in the Services menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use TBXML for XML Parsing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented with a few XML parsers, and settled on &lt;a href="http://www.tbxml.co.uk/TBXML/TBXML_Free.html"&gt;TBXML&lt;/a&gt; as my preferred parser. It's got the best combination of performance and ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is not necessarily the best for all purposes. See &lt;a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/553/how-to-chose-the-best-xml-parser-for-your-iphone-project"&gt;How to Choose the Best XML Parser for Your iPhone Project&lt;/a&gt; for a survey of available XML parsers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iphone"></category><category term="ipad"></category><category term="iosdev"></category></entry><entry><title>App Idea: Prose Translation Assistant</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/app-idea-prose-translation-assistant.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-07T02:03:21-05:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T02:03:21-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-03-07:/app-idea-prose-translation-assistant.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(This is just an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;A friend has started a personal project to translate the works of Jules Verne from the original French into English, as he is dissatisfied with the existing English translations. He is going about it pretty much the way I would: he has a browser window open with the original French text, a browser window with Google Translate, and a text editor where he is writing the English translation. He also has a French-English dictionary on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered whether there might be some software available that is specifically designed for this purpose. Some Googling finds plenty of applications to assist in translation, but all the ones I found are designed to help translate conversations, e-mails, or other such things. I couldn't find anything designed for assisting with translating a novel, play, or other such work, where the translation needs to be written by a human in an accurate-but-artful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking about how I would design an application to assist with this process, making it less necessary to switch between various applications and documents.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
The basic presentation in my mind is a table with three columns: the first column contains the original text, the second column contains the text translated into the target language, and the third column is intended to hold notes. There would be a button and simple keyboard shortcut for showing/hiding the third column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be one paragraph per row. So, the main window would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; P# &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;French&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;English&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

L'année 1866 fut marquée par un événement bizarre, un phénomène inexpliqué et inexplicable que personne n'a sans doute oublié. Sans parler des rumeurs qui agitaient les populations des ports et surexcitaient l'esprit public à l'intérieur des continents les gens de mer furent particulièrement émus. Les négociants, armateurs, capitaines de navires, skippers et masters de l'Europe et de l'Amérique, officiers des marines militaires de tous pays, et, après eux, les gouvernements des divers États des deux continents, se préoccupèrent de ce fait au plus haut point.

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

The year 1866 was marked by a bizarre development, an unexplained and downright inexplicable phenomenon that surely no one has forgotten. Without getting into those rumors that upset civilians in the seaports and deranged the public mind even far inland, it must be said that professional seamen were especially alarmed. Traders, shipowners, captains of vessels, skippers, and master mariners from Europe and America, naval officers from every country, and at their heels the various national governments on these two continents, were all extremely disturbed by the business.

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

Does the English word "downright" in the first sentence capture the correct meaning?

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

En effet, depuis quelque temps, plusieurs navires s'étaient rencontrés sur mer avec « une chose énorme » un objet long, fusiforme, parfois phosphorescent, infiniment plus vaste et plus rapide qu'une baleine.

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

In essence, over a period of time several ships had encountered "an enormous thing" at sea, a long spindle–shaped object, sometimes giving off a phosphorescent glow, infinitely bigger and faster than any whale.

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

Les faits relatifs à cette apparition, consignés aux divers livres de bord, s'accordaient assez exactement sur la structure de l'objet ou de l'être en question, la vitesse inouïe de ses mouvements, la puissance surprenante de sa locomotion, la vie particulière dont il semblait doué. Si c'était un cétacé, il surpassait en volume tous ceux que la science avait classés jusqu'alors. Ni Cuvier, ni Lacépède, ni M. Dumeril, ni M. de Quatrefages n'eussent admis l'existence d'un tel monstre — à moins de l'avoir vu, ce qui s'appelle vu de leurs propres yeux de savants.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

The facts concerning this apparition, as recorded in various logbooks, agreed pretty accurately the structure of the object or creature in question, the unprecedented speed of its movements, the surprising power of locomotion, life which he seemed particularly gifted. If it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all that science had previously ordered. Neither Cuvier, Lacepede neither nor Mr. Dumeril nor M. de Quatre had not admitted the existence of such a monster - at least to have seen, which is called saw with their own eyes of scholars.

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

(Automatic translation by Google Translate.)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would then be a set of floating auxiliary windows that provide assistance. For example, a Google Translate window would appear which displays translated text. By default, it would display a translation of the current paragraph, but if one or more words were selected, then it would display the translation for only the selected word/phrase/sentence. There would also be a Babelfish window, a window with a dictionary for the target language, and windows for any other sources of translation assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a new translation project, you would import the original-language text, and could also then import a translation, or could allow the application to automatically generate an initial translation using Google Translate or another service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that &lt;em&gt;paragraph&lt;/em&gt; is the best chunk size for this kind of work. I think a sentence is too short, as it is likely one would want to split or combine sentences when writing a nicely flowing translation. A chapter is too long to be an atomic unit, but there should be a way to create some sort of outline view to show and hide larger groups of paragraphs. (Are there written languages that don't have a concept analogous to a &lt;em&gt;paragraph&lt;/em&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each paragraph can be marked with a color to indicate its status: &lt;em&gt;unedited initial translation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;edited but incomplete&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;needs review&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be an easy way to share the project with others, and merge others' work into your own. (Maybe one more column for each additional author?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure whether this should be a desktop app or a web app. A web app would make it easier to share work between people and let people review it, so that's probably the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's the idea. It's too much work for me to try to tackle, but maybe somebody else wants to try, or can point me to existing examples of this type of product.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="idea"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I Loved The Social Network</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/why-i-loved-social-network.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-27T01:41:21-05:00</published><updated>2011-02-27T01:41:21-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-02-27:/why-i-loved-social-network.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this the night before the Oscars, but that is not why I'm writing.

I'll say up front that this entire discussion is about the story and characters in the movie, which don't necessarily match the real-life story. When I talk about &lt;em&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/em&gt;, I'm talking about the character in the movie. I don't care how true the movie is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie does a good job of presenting all sides of the story. To the Winklevosses, the story is that they had a great idea, and Mark Zuckerberg stole it and made a lot of money that was rightfully theirs. In contrast, Zuckerberg doesn't think he stole anything: the Winklevosses had a stupid idea, and he had a better idea, and he was wildly successful in executing that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the key to the movie: the difference between having an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt;, and actually &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; something. I don't think it matters who had the idea. I think the person who creates something deserves almost all the credit for it, regardless of where the idea came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you're at Starbucks one day, and you overhear a barista saying to another that there ought to be an easier way to control the production of froth in a latte. You go home, spend a few months inventing some new froth-production device, and then you sell that device to Starbucks for a million dollars. How much do you owe that barista you overheard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer: nothing. Everyone has ideas all the time. Lots of people independently have the same ideas. Ideas have little value on their own. What matters is &lt;em&gt;doing something&lt;/em&gt; with the ideas you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite blurb about this principle is by the author Neil Gaiman, in his essay &lt;a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F"&gt;"Where do you get your ideas?"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every published writer has had it - the people who come up to you and tell you that they've Got An Idea. And boy, is it a Doozy. It's such a Doozy that they want to Cut You In On It. The proposal is always the same - they'll tell you the Idea (the hard bit), you write it down and turn it into a novel (the easy bit), the two of you can split the money fifty-fifty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is not the hard bit. The hard bit is making the thing, and then improving the thing, and then throwing the thing away and starting over, and then showing it to people, and being rejected, and keeping at it until the thing is right, even when everyone is telling you that you are doing it all wrong.  And then when the thing is right, you don't relax; you start on your next thing. It is better to have lots of pretty good ideas than to have one Great Idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a computer programmer, and I felt a lot more sympathy for the Zuckerberg character than most people do. He's a smart guy who made a lot of money by writing some software, and he didn't let others get in the way. He has some problems dealing with people, but his personality defects are similar to my own. When I walked out of that movie, Mark Zuckerberg was my hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's not a perfect hero. He misled the Winklevosses, and he betrayed his best friend. I am neither excusing nor ignoring Zuckerberg's dark side, but there are relevant lessons here too. First, if you can't make your thing yourself, and you are counting on someone else to make the thing for you, you are in a precarious position. Second, be careful about who you let help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt; sticks in my brain because it keeps reminding me of the importance of &lt;em&gt;making stuff&lt;/em&gt;. It's important to daydream, to exchange ideas with others, to learn and hone your craft, and to organize your life to give you the time and energy to work, but what's really important is that &lt;em&gt;you have to work&lt;/em&gt;. You don't get points just for being smart.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category><category term="rant"></category><category term="movies"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting Up for Use of Microsoft Symbol Server</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/setting-use-microsoft-symbol-server.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-23T22:13:30-05:00</published><updated>2011-02-23T22:13:30-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-02-23:/setting-use-microsoft-symbol-server.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When debugging native Win32 code, it is useful to have the debug symbols for all of Microsoft's DLLs.

I did a lot of work in the 90's and early 00's with Visual&amp;nbsp;Studios 5, 6, and 2003, but then I had a few years away from Windows development, and I've had limited experience with .NET development.  So I'm constantly discovering "new things" about Visual&amp;nbsp;Studio that my coworkers already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nifty feature of Visual&amp;nbsp;Studio is "code snippets", which are basically little bits of code that can be quickly inserted into a source file using Intellisense.  The inserted code includes placeholders that can be replaced with whatever you need.  For example, if you are typing away in a C# source file and type the keyword &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, you'll see the Intellsense window pop up with "for" as the selected item, and if you hit the Tab key a couple of times a complete &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; statement with braces, a loop variable, and everything will be inserted.  You can then hit Tab to move to the loop variable name (in case you don't like &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;) and again to go into the loop body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Other IDEs have similar features, calling them &lt;em&gt;abbreviations&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;macros&lt;/em&gt;, etc.  You don't need to tell me that Visual&amp;nbsp;Studio isn't magically unique.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual&amp;nbsp;Studio has a whole bunch of these snippets built in, but you can also define your own by writing an XML file and saving it where Visual&amp;nbsp;Studio can find it.  For example, here is a snippet I wrote to quickly insert &lt;code&gt;String.Format()&lt;/code&gt; expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot; ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;CodeSnippet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Format=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;1.0.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;String.Format&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Description&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Creates a String.Format() call&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Description&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Default&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;format&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Default&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ToolTip&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Replace with arguments&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ToolTip&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Default&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Default&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Literal&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Declarations&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Language=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;CSharp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[String.Format(&amp;quot;$format$&amp;quot;, $arguments$)$end$]]&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Code&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Snippet&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/CodeSnippet&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/CodeSnippets&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just save this as a file called &lt;code&gt;StringFormat.snippet&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets&lt;/code&gt; folder.  (You can specify another location using the &lt;em&gt;Code Snippets Manager&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Tools&lt;/em&gt; menu.)  Then, when editing a C# source file, if you type &lt;code&gt;sf&lt;/code&gt; and hit Tab a couple of times, this will magically appear in your code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;String.Format("&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;format&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;",&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;arguments&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;format&lt;/em&gt; placeholder will be selected, so you can replace it with your format string, then hit Tab and the &lt;em&gt;arguments&lt;/em&gt; placeholder will be selected, so you can replace it.  You can keep hitting Tab to go back and forth between the placeholders.  When finished, hit Return and the cursor will go to the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, snippets only work for C#, Visual&amp;nbsp;Basic, and XML editing. Most of my work is in C++, so I have to keep writing code the old-fashioned way there (or use macros).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I have been talking about Visual&amp;nbsp;Studio&amp;nbsp;2008.  "Why aren't you using Visual Studio&amp;nbsp;2010?" some will ask.  Shut&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty easy to do manually on a Mac: Just right-click the PPT file, select &lt;strong&gt;Open With... -&amp;gt; Keynote&lt;/strong&gt; from the menu (which reads the PowerPoint file into Keynote), then &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; Save As...&lt;/strong&gt; to store it where you want it. However, I am a programmer, so I would rather spend a few hours figuring out how to write a program to do a repetitive task than simply spend the five minutes needed to do it by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I tried using Apple's Automator utility, which is supposed to make stuff like this easy, but I couldn't figure it out. So, I took the plunge into AppleScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with every foray I make into AppleScriptLand, I was frustrated, annoyed, saddened, and exhausted by the experience. But I did succeed (if two hours spent futzing with AppleScript can possibly be called a &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you have need for a utility for converting a bunch of PowerPoint files to Keynote, open up the AppleScript Editor and copy and paste this script into the window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;on open droppedFiles
    set theDestinationFolder to (choose folder with prompt &amp;quot;Choose destination folder&amp;quot;) as Unicode text
    repeat with theFile in droppedFiles
        tell application &amp;quot;Keynote&amp;quot;
            open theFile
            set theSlideshow to slideshow 1
            set theDestinationPath to theDestinationFolder &amp;amp; (name of theSlideshow)
            save theSlideshow in theDestinationPath
            close theSlideshow
        end tell
    end repeat
end open
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Compile&lt;/strong&gt; button, and assuming you see no errors, choose &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; Save&lt;/strong&gt;, set the File Format to &lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;, and save it to the desired place with the desired name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to convert files, just select them in the Finder and drag them onto the application icon. You will be prompted for a destination folder, then the script will do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script looks pretty simple and straightforward, right? Well, AppleScript is a language that is easy to read, but very, very difficult to write. Every programming language that tries to "look like plain English" is a nightmare to use, because like English, the rules are illogical, arbitrary, and self-contradictory. Every application, like Keynote, has its own commands and object types, and the documentation is poor, so you end up doing a lot of experimentation and hair-pulling. The hardest part of this particular script was figuring out that I needed to add the &lt;code&gt;as Unicode text&lt;/code&gt; conversion in order to produce a valid file path.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of non-geeks have never used a dual-monitor setup: you will just have to trust me when I tell you that, for a programmer or any other person who needs to look at a lot of information all at once, it is much more productive than a single-monitor setup. It's not a luxury&amp;mdash;it's a necessity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I have to leave the home office and go into the office office, I take a Windows laptop. This is less productive, due both to the small screen size and the fact that I have only one screen. So I decided to try out a couple of apps that allow one to use an iPad as a second monitor.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
I tried &lt;a href="http://avatron.com/apps/air-display/"&gt;Air Display&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.maxivista.com/ipad_monitor.htm"&gt;MaxiVista&lt;/a&gt;. Both apps have been available for a while, but Air Display originally only supported Mac, while MaxiVista only supported Windows, so there was no choice to be made. However, Air Display now supports both Mac and Windows, so I wanted to try both apps to see which provided the better experience on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both apps require a wi-fi connection between iPad and computer  Both apps require that you download a free program to install and run on the computer side. Both apps are currently selling for $9.99 in the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MaxiVista was the first app I tried. Setup on my Windows 7 laptop was easy, and It Just Worked. I started the app on the iPad, then started the app on the laptop, and the laptop immediately found the iPad on the wi-fi network. I was a little disappointed with the speed of display updates on the iPad monitor, but it was usable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I tried Air Display. The setup was a little more difficult. After installing the Air Display application on the laptop and rebooting, it started automatically but could not locate my iPad. After trying a few troubleshooting measures, I eventually figured out that it had to be Run as Administrator. After I worked that out, it ran fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Display provides a better display experience.  While MaxiVista feels like running VNC over an Internet connection, Air Display feels like running with a directly connected monitor on a ten-year-old computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Display lets you use the touchscreen like a mouse. MaxiVista doesn't have that feature (but they say it is coming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Air Display works on both Windows and Macs is nice.  The "Windows laptop" I've been talking about is actually a MacBook Pro with Boot Camp, so it's nice to be able to use the iPad as a second monitor with whichever OS I have running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up, Air Display is the clear winner for me.  It's faster and more capable, for the same price.  Even if MaxiVista was free, I'd gladly pay the ten bucks for Air Display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; Note that someone from MaxiVista has responded with a comment describing configuration settings that could improve its performance.

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what's in store for me this year. I may be offered permanent employment with TransCore. I may start an MBA program in the fall. I'm sure there will be surprises and setbacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough for now. It's time for the hourly dog-poop removal. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category><category term="birthday"></category></entry><entry><title>To MBA, or Not to MBA, That Is the Question</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/mba-or-not-mba-question.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-10T05:53:47-05:00</published><updated>2011-01-10T05:53:47-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2011-01-10:/mba-or-not-mba-question.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've starting taking some business classes that are prerequisites for starting an MBA program in the fall.

So you may be seeing a lot more business-school-related musings than computer-programming-related musings for a while.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
Why Go Back to School?
==============&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't made the final decision about whether I am actually going to start the MBA program.  It will be expensive, it will take up a lot of my time, and I don't really know why I'm doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few years, I've wanted to go back to school.  I didn't take college very seriously the first time around, and I've had this romantic notion that if I returned, I could have the wonderfully educational and enlightening &lt;em&gt;college experience&lt;/em&gt; that our high-school guidance counselors told us about.  I know it wouldn't really be that way, particularly since I'm old and can't be a full-time student, but the notion still appeals to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered going back to get an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science, but not for very long.  I did well in my computer-science studies while pursuing my B.S., but the academic side of things never appealed to me as much as practical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered law school, as it seems like it would include a lot of activities I like: reading detailed technical documents, applying abstract principles to concrete situations, etc.  But that didn't feel right either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to Business School.  I have never really understood how business works.  I write my little programs and collect my paychecks, but that has been the extent to which I've understood about the forces that shape my career.  I had a brief stint as a manager several years ago, and while I found it stressful and unpleasant&amp;mdash;I eventually quit and took a year off from work&amp;mdash;I found a lot of it exhilarating.  I found that I really enjoyed talking to customers and being involved in the company's higher-level decision making.  However, I felt completely incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I wasn't as bad as it as I thought, and really should not have expected myself to do any better in my first asssignment.  But I'm the kind of person who wants to feel &lt;em&gt;prepared&lt;/em&gt;.  So before I do such a thing again, I want some training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking into MBA programs, and eventually found one that fit well.  Classes are held in the evenings in a nearby city, and the school offers some accelerated courses to teach non-business-majors the stuff that they should have already learned in business school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Am I Giving Up Programming to Become a Manager?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not one of those programmers who wants to give up coding to become a manager.  Developing software is something I do well, and so I'm not looking to replace my programming skillset with a managerial skillset.  Rather, I'm hoping that this new knowledge will supplement what I already know, making me a software developer who doesn't look down at his shoes during business meetings, and who is willing to give useful answers to executives rather than a lot of &lt;em&gt;it depends&lt;/em&gt; answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll start my own company someday.  Maybe I'll rise up through the ranks of a corporation.  Maybe I'll design and develop the software that business people have always wished they wanted.  I don't know, and I don't think I need to know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;But Why Go to School, When I Could Just Be a Manager?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are plenty of arguments against getting an MBA.  Many people say that it is a waste of time, and the best way to learn about business is just to dive in and start a business or start managing people.  But, you see, I &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; that, and I know I'm not going to pick things up that way.  I need a foundation.  Formality gives me confidence.  When I feel like I know a little bit, then I'll be ready for the sink-or-swim educational method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started my first prerequisite course, and the first two chapters of the book have already given me some insights as to what I did wrong and how stupid my expectations were.  Maybe these business people actually know some things worth learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mba"></category></entry><entry><title>Now Running on Amazon EC2</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/now-running-amazon-ec2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-19T23:13:19-05:00</published><updated>2010-11-19T23:13:19-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-11-19:/now-running-amazon-ec2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This blog is now running in the &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)&lt;/a&gt;.

Migrating the blog over to the new server was relatively straightforward, using Drupal's &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate"&gt;Backup and Migrate&lt;/a&gt; module.

Migrating the blog over to the new server was relatively straightforward, using Drupal's &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate"&gt;Backup and Migrate&lt;/a&gt; module. After &lt;a href="/2010/11/12/setting-drupal-ubuntu-1010-ec2"&gt;getting Drupal set up on the new server&lt;/a&gt;, I just copied all my themes, modules, and files from the old server to the new and then did a restore of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using a &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/"&gt;t1.micro&lt;/a&gt; EC2 instance, which is the cheapest and least-powerful EC2 instance. So far, it seems to be handling the load fine, but I'll need to see how it works over the next few weeks. If all goes well, I'm going to try moving all my other web sites to the same server. None of my sites gets more than a few hundred hits per day, so if I can handle them all with one cheap easy-to-manage server, I'll be very happy. But if I have to upgrade to a beefier instance, all it takes is a couple of minutes and a few dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell how bad being dependent on Amazon is in comparison to being dependent on the web hosting services I've used. I suspect it will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm switching to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html"&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; for my e-mail and other such services. Configuring and managing your own e-mail servers these days is a colossal waste of time unless you have some very special requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Few Weeks Later...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon AWS charges for November: $2.88.  $2.40 of that was for having an unattached elastic IP address for 240 hours, and $0.17 was for running a Small (rather than Micro) instance for a couple of hours, so I expect my costs going forward to be lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS charges for December: $0.52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS charges for January: $0.52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In contrast, my previous hosting plans cost me a total of $20 per month.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's webmaster tools indicate that my blog pages are now downloading in about 150 ms, as opposed to around 400 ms with my old provider. So performance seems to have improved quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ubuntu"></category><category term="ec2"></category><category term="drupal"></category><category term="admin"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting Up Drupal 6 on Ubuntu 10.10 on EC2</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/setting-drupal-6-ubuntu-1010-ec2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-13T03:14:23-05:00</published><updated>2010-11-13T03:14:23-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-11-13:/setting-drupal-6-ubuntu-1010-ec2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For several years, I've been using pretty-cheap web hosting services for my blog, my &lt;a href="http://capablehands.net"&gt;corporate website&lt;/a&gt;, and other webby things.

However, I'm pretty sure that it would be even cheaper to use &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Amazon EC2&lt;/a&gt;, especially as they now offer &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/"&gt;free usage&lt;/a&gt; for a year. I also like the ease with which one can scale EC2 servers up or down, and run temporary instances for a few cents per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this means I have to figure out how to move everything from where it is to a new EC2 instance. Most of the stuff I care about is managed in &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, so step one is figuring out how to set up Drupal on an EC2 host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as my OS, because I'm a long-time Debian user and my brushes with Ubuntu have been positive. A little research showed that they had an easy-to-install &lt;code&gt;drupal6&lt;/code&gt; package and a few other packages that I plan to use in my plans for world conquest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no matter how easy/straightforward things look, they are always a little bit complicated. Here are my notes for setting things up, which may be helpful to others, and will probably be helpful to me whenever I end up redoing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume the reader has basic knowledge of how to connect to servers via SSH, knows a little bit about setting up Apache and Drupal, and is comfortable using a text editor to modify configuration files.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Launch Ubuntu 10.10 Instance on EC2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For more details and help, check out the &lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EC2StartersGuide"&gt;EC2StartersGuide&lt;/a&gt; in Ubuntu Community Documentation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't already have an Amazon Web Services account, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ and click the Sign Up Now button. After you give them all your info (including credit card info), you may need to wait for authorization to use the services. (I had to wait about 12 hours.) Then create and download your private keys and certificates. (Note: in the rest of this document, I'll use the symbol &lt;code&gt;$EC2_PKEY&lt;/code&gt; to mean the full path and name of your stored private key file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign in to the &lt;a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home"&gt;AWS Management Console&lt;/a&gt; (which, unfortunately, requires Adobe Flash Player, so you can't do this on an iPad).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;Amazon EC2&lt;/em&gt; tab, and click the &lt;em&gt;Launch Instance&lt;/em&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a suitable AMI. I went with ami-508c7839, which is a 32-bit EBS-based Ubuntu 10.10 instance that runs in the US-East availability zone. For lists of other available Ubuntu AMIs, see the &lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EC2StartersGuide"&gt;EC2StartersGuide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://alestic.com/"&gt;Alestic&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;Instance Details&lt;/em&gt; page of the wizard, set these details:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of instances: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instance type: Micro (required for Free Tier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability Zone: No preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch Instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Advanced Instance Options&lt;/em&gt;, accept the defaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill in something for the Name tag. You will eventually have a list of instances, so make this descriptive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a new key pair or create a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose an existing security group or create a new security group. It is &lt;strong&gt;very important&lt;/strong&gt; that you set up a security group that allows access via the SSH port, and you probably want the HTTP port open also.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming everything looks good, click the &lt;em&gt;Launch Instance&lt;/em&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the &lt;em&gt;Amazon EC2&lt;/em&gt; tab in the AWS Management Console. You should see your new instance with a status of "Pending". Wait for it to become "Running".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select your new instance in the top pane. In the bottom pane, you will see a bunch of info. Select the contents of the &lt;em&gt;Public DNS&lt;/em&gt; field. It will look something like this: &lt;code&gt;ec2-XX-XX-XX-XXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;. This is the hostname you will use to connect. In the rest of this guide, I'll denote this address as &lt;code&gt;$EC2_HOST&lt;/code&gt;in the rest of this article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that you can connect to the new instance. If you have Mac OS X, Linux, or another UNIXy box, you can run SSH like this: &lt;code&gt;ssh -i $EC2_PKEY ubuntu@$EC2_HOST&lt;/code&gt;. If you are on Windows, then figure out how to use &lt;a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;.  If all is well, you will be greeted with a prompt like this: &lt;code&gt;ubuntu@ip-XX-XX-XXX-XXX:~$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set Up DNS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use that Public DNS to connect to your server forever, but you will probably want a real domain name. So, head on over to your favorite registrar and register a new domain, or change an existing domain to point to your new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon recommends using a CNAME (alias) record that points to your EC2 instance's public DNS. However, I've found that the public DNS can change for no apparent reason, so if you expect people to connect to your site, you should use Amazon's Elastic IP service to assign a static IP address to your server. (Note that after assigning the static IP, the public DNS for your server will change to match the static IP, so be sure to refresh your EC2 dashboard instance display after setting up the Elastic IP to get the final DNS or IP address.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll use the symbol $MY_HOSTNAME in the remainder of this document to denote the domain name that you want to use. (In my case, $MY_HOSTNAME is "happyspacelab.com".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Install Drupal and Related Packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to your SSH command prompt on the EC2 box (reconnecting if necessary).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the package index with this command: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade existing packages with this command: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get upgrade&lt;/code&gt; (Answer "Yes" when asked whether to continue.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Drupal and all dependencies (Apache, MySQL, PHP, etc.) with this command: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install drupal6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be prompted for various passwords and names. Write down whatever you enter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail Configuration: No configuration (unless you really want to do this now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database type: mysql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default choices for everything else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart Apache with this command: &lt;code&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that Apache is working and all the firewalls have port 80 open by visiting your site with a web browser. You can use &lt;code&gt;http://$EC2_HOST&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;http://$MY_HOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt; (assuming enough time has passed for DNS propagation). You should see a web page that says "It Works!".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the Drupal installation page: &lt;code&gt;http://$EC2_HOST/drupal6/install.php&lt;/code&gt; (and then follow normal Drupal installation procedures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the link to set up in English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill in the fields and click &lt;em&gt;Send and continue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: You will not be able to enable Clean URLs at this time. Don't worry; we'll get to that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have not set up email on the server, you'll get a warning that mail could not be sent. Ignore.
At this point, you should have a usable Drupal installation, accessible at &lt;code&gt;http://$EC2_HOST/drupal6/&lt;/code&gt; or at &lt;code&gt;http://$MY_HOSTNAME/drupal6&lt;/code&gt;. Go into the Administration screens and configure the site as desired, or wait until you have finished subsequent steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set Up Virtual Host&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/drupal6/&lt;/code&gt; part of the URL is ugly, so we'll set up virtual hosting so that the Drupal content is available at &lt;code&gt;http://$MY_HOSTNAME/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to your SSH command prompt on the EC2 box (reconnecting if necessary).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /etc/apache2/sites-available&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new file named $MY_HOSTNAME (substituting your actual hostname), with these contents (and remember to start your editor with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;):
    &amp;lt;VirtualHost &lt;em&gt;:80&amp;gt;
        ServerAdmin webmaster@$MY_HOSTNAME.com
        ServerName $MY_HOSTNAME
        ServerAlias $MY_HOSTNAME &lt;/em&gt;.$MY_HOSTNAME.com
        DocumentRoot /usr/share/drupal6
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteOptions inherit
    &amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo a2ensite $MY_HOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo a2enmod rewrite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the file &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/drupal6/.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; with a text editor (remember &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;), and uncomment the line that says
    RewriteBase /&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;code&gt;http://$MY_HOSTNAME/&lt;/code&gt; with a web browser. You should see the Drupal front page, rather than the "It Works!" page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enable Clean URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the virtual hosting stuff set up, you can now enable Clean URLs in Drupal. Log in to the Drupal page as administrator, go to Administrator &amp;gt; Site Configuration &amp;gt; Clean URLs, select &lt;em&gt;Enable&lt;/em&gt; and click &lt;em&gt;Save configuration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set Up Memcached&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon will be charging us for EBS I/O requests (we only get one million free I/O requests per month with the Free Tier), so let's set up Drupal to use &lt;a href="http://memcached.org/"&gt;memcached&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the amount of I/O and improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple setup, using a single memcached instance running on the local machine. For more complicated situations, refer to the &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/memcache"&gt;Drupal memcache module documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install memcached php5-memcached&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the file &lt;code&gt;/etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/memcached.ini&lt;/code&gt;, add this line: &lt;code&gt;memcache.hash_strategy="consistent"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and unarchive the &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/memcache"&gt;Memcache API and Integration&lt;/a&gt; module in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/drupal6/sites/all/modules&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your site's &lt;code&gt;settings.php&lt;/code&gt;, add the snippet provided below to set &lt;code&gt;cache_inc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;memcache_key_prefix&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Administer &amp;gt; Site building &amp;gt; Modules and enable the Memcache Admin module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Administer &amp;gt; Site configuration &amp;gt; Memcache and enable "Show memcache statistics at the bottom of each page". After this is enabled, you can scroll down to the bottom of the page to verify that memcache is working and that things are in the cache. (You can then disable this if you find the display annoying.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the snippet to be added/modified in &lt;code&gt;settings.php&lt;/code&gt;. In place of &lt;code&gt;some_unique_prefix&lt;/code&gt;, substitute your site's name or some other value that is unique for your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$conf = array(
    &amp;#39;cache_inc&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;/usr/share/drupal6/sites/all/modules/memcache/memcache.inc&amp;#39;,
    &amp;#39;memcache_key_prefix&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;some_unique_prefix&amp;#39;,
);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Set up Alternative PHP Cache&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a further measure to reduce the number of I/O requests and improve performance, we'll install the &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.apc.php"&gt;Alternative PHP Cache&lt;/a&gt; (APC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install php-apc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following line to &lt;code&gt;/etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
apc.stat = 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can monitor the performance of APC by installing the &lt;code&gt;apc.php&lt;/code&gt; script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo gunzip /usr/share/doc/php-apc/apc.php.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo ln -s /usr/share/doc/php-apc/apc.php /usr/share/drupal6/apc.php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a web browser, go to &lt;code&gt;http://$MY_HOSTNAME/apc.php&lt;/code&gt;. You should see stats for APC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance Adjustments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Administer &amp;gt; Site configuration &amp;gt; Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;em&gt;Caching Mode&lt;/em&gt; to "Normal"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;em&gt;Page compression&lt;/em&gt; to "Disabled" (Apache is already configured to compress stuff, so there is no need to have Drupal do it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;em&gt;Block cache&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Optimize CSS files&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Optimize JavaScript files&lt;/em&gt; to "Enabled"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;Save configuration&lt;/em&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set Up Drupal Multisite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are cheap enough to go with free hosting, you'll probably want to go ahead and put multiple Drupal sites, each with their own doman name, on this same host. This is fairly easy to do. Here are a bunch of documents describing how to do it: http://drupal.org/node/43816&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, here are quick-and-dirty instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each site, create a file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-available&lt;/code&gt; like you did in the &lt;strong&gt;Set Up Virtual Host&lt;/strong&gt; section, above.  Substitute the appropriate host name in each new file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /usr/share/drupal6/sites&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; site to a directory named $MY_HOSTNAME: &lt;code&gt;sudo cp -a default $MY_HOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each site, you need to create another database. Here's the easy way to do that:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run this command: &lt;code&gt;sudo dpkg-reconfigure drupal6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer the prompts as follows:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinstall database: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database type: mysql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connection method: Unix socket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name of the database's administrative user: root&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password: [root's MySQL password, as you specified when MySQL was installed]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Username for drupal6: [enter a site-specific user name to own the new database, e.g., "myhostname2"]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database name: [enter a site-specific database name, e.g., "myhostname2"] &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new configuration is in the &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/drupal6/sites/default&lt;/code&gt; directory. Copy that to host-specific directory: &lt;code&gt;sudo cp -a default myhostname2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sites\default&lt;/code&gt; directory that you just copied has a &lt;code&gt;files&lt;/code&gt; directory which is a symlink to &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/drupal6/files&lt;/code&gt;. If you don't want all your Drupal instances to put their files in the same place, then do the following:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo rm myhostname2/files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir myhostname2/files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo chown myhostname2/files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo chgrp www-data myhostname2/files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo chmod 750 myhostname2/files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;code&gt;http://myhostname/install.php&lt;/code&gt; to complete the installation process for this new Drupal instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the site-specific steps for setting up memcached (update settings.php, enable the module, etc.), and repeat the Performance Adjustments steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on this method of setting up multisite on Ubuntu, see http://drupal.org/node/138889&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up a few sites this way, I found that the daily Drupal cron job would run for some of my sites, but not for others. The cron job is triggered by the file &lt;code&gt;/etc/cron.d/drupal6&lt;/code&gt;, which calls &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/drupal6/scripts.cron.sh&lt;/code&gt;, but I never figured out exactly why it was working for some sites and other others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to get the cron job running for all sites by adding a &lt;code&gt;baseurl.php&lt;/code&gt; file to each of the &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/drupal6/sites&lt;/code&gt; subdirectories. &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/drupal6/scripts.cron.sh&lt;/code&gt; looks at this file, and at &lt;code&gt;settings.php&lt;/code&gt;, to determine the appropriate URL for invoking the script that site. The contents of each file should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;base_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://example.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Substitute the appropriate host name for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the URL should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a slash at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cleaning Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you've followed all the instructions above, and you've got a working Drupal server. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that Amazon is going to be charging you for this instance that you've set up. Even if you stop the instance, Amazon still charges you by the hour. So, if you aren't really ready to use this instance, you'll want to terminate it via the AWS Management Console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that "terminating" really means "deleting". After terminating the instance, you won't be able to restart it. It's gone forever, unless you take steps to save the image in S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Odds and Ends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Drupal &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate"&gt;Backup and Migrate&lt;/a&gt; module makes it easy to move Drupal data from your old site to your new site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't want to set up your system as a mail server, but do want SMTP to work so that Drupal can send you mail, look at the &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/smtp"&gt;SMTP Authentication&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/"&gt;Duplicity&lt;/a&gt; is a nifty tool for making incremental backups to Amazon S3 (or other destinations). See http://www.problogdesign.com/how-to/automatic-amazon-s3-backups-on-ubuntu-debian/.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To-Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few little things I want to figure out when I have time. If anyone already knows the answers, I'd appreciate learning about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ubuntu AMI is a 15 GB boot image, but I am using less than 2 GB of it. The Amazon Free Tier only allows 10 GB of EBS storage, so I've thought about shrinking the boot image. (On the other hand, 5 GB of excess storage only costs fifty cents per month, so why worry?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to automatically back up my volume and my MySQL database to S3 periodically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some links I traversed while figuring this stuff out:&lt;/p&gt;

I picked them up at school and we made the 45-minute drive back home. As we parked the car, my wife noticed that she didn't have her iPhone.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
She initially thought she had left it back in the teachers' lounge, so she called some coworkers to ask them to check. None were still at school, so one of her friends drove to school to look for it. It wasn't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my wife fired up MobileMe and went to &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/find-my-iphone.html"&gt;Find My iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. It indicated that the phone was on Georgia SR 400 (a multilane freeway), in the northbound lanes between exits 14 and 15. She realized that she must have left the phone on the roof of the car while she was getting in, and it fell off when we were on the freeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news was that it was reporting its location, so we knew approximately where it was and that it was still functional. We hopped back in the car to go retrieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know how accurate the reported location would be. I suspected we'd be walking up and down the freeway in the dark and beating the bushes on the side of the road to find it. But she spotted it immediately, a few feet to the right of the edge of the freeway, within a few dozen yards of where it was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled over and went to pick it up. We could tell from several yards away that the glass was cracked, but it turned out that only the back glass of the iPhone 4 was cracked. The front glass was fine, and everything was fully functional. (A little Googling indicates that Apple will replace the back glass for $29.) The bumper was a little mangled, but apparently it did its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all in all, this was a good outcome. We got lucky in that the iPhone didn't break when it hit the pavement, that it didn't land where a car would run it over, and that it didn't skitter off into the brush, but if we hadn't had MobileMe, we wouldn't have ever known where to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think that MobileMe is overpriced, and think about cancelling it, but I'll remember this incident whenever I think that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epilogue:&lt;/em&gt; My wife called the friendly neighborhood AT&amp;amp;T store (where she bought the phone) and asked about fixing the broken back glass. They directed her to a cellphone repair service which quoted $130 to fix it. I called the Apple Store, and they confirmed that they would fix it for $29. So, once again, AT&amp;amp;T proves itself to be the worst part of the iPhone customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the end, Apple replaced the back glass at no charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of iOS 4.2.1, released 2010/11/22, Find My Phone is now a free service. You don't need to pay for MobileMe to get it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iphone"></category><category term="apple"></category></entry><entry><title>PowerShell and Unicode</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/powershell-and-unicode.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-21T12:01:58-04:00</published><updated>2010-07-21T12:01:58-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-07-21:/powershell-and-unicode.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After being away from the Windows developer world for a few years, I have been pleased to find some of the nice things that Microsoft has given us.

Visual Studio has some really nice refactoring capabilities. The Windows 7 user experience rivals OS X. And as an alternative to the venerable &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt;, we now have a much better command-line shell: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell"&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like most about PowerShell is that it feels more like a UNIX shell. It supports a lot of UNIXy commands (&lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;). It lets you use either forward slashes or backslashes in paths This is good for someone like me who can never remember what OS I'm using when I start typing a command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, Microsoft can't give us something new without throwing in some surprisingly inappropriate behavior.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
A couple of days ago, I needed to create a patch for a Subversion repository, and so I typed the typical command to do so (which works fine in UNIX shells and with &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;svn diff &amp;gt; my_patch.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I then looked at my patch to verify that it looked good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cat my_patch.diff | more
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everything looked fine. However, when I later tried to apply the patch to another Subversion workspace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;patch -p0 -i my_patch.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I got errors. I opened up &lt;code&gt;my_patch.diff&lt;/code&gt; in Vim, and realized it was a UTF-16-encoded file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither &lt;code&gt;svn&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; know how to deal with Unicode. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wasting an hour trying various &lt;code&gt;svn&lt;/code&gt; command-line options and diff utilities, I finally stumbled onto the answer. It turns out that, in PowerShell, &lt;code&gt;svn diff &amp;gt; my_patch.diff&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;svn diff | out-file my_patch.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and (get this), the &lt;code&gt;out-file&lt;/code&gt; cmdlet &lt;strong&gt;encodes its output as UTF-16 by default&lt;/strong&gt;, regardless of what the input encoding was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This default behavior makes sense for &lt;code&gt;out-file&lt;/code&gt;, but it is counter-intuitive that the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; redirection operator would take ASCII and convert it to Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make PowerShell do the right thing, you have to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;svn diff | out-file -encoding ascii my_patch.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

People recognize that there are better options available than CVS, but it's been cranking along fine for 15 years, and they see no compelling reason to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I really like being able to commit incremental changes often in my own personal branches, and while not connected to the company network (I work from home). So I've been checking out files from the CVS repository, using &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; locally to manage modifications, and then periodically committing those changes back to the remote CVS repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I'd write up what I'm doing, in case others want to try the same thing, or others can tell me a better way to do what I'm doing. I'm still a bit of a Git newbie, so if I'm doing something stupid, please let me know.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
I'm assuming the reader has a basic understanding of CVS and Git. If not, see the &lt;a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/"&gt;CVS manual&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html"&gt;Git tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. I predominantly work on Windows, but I use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell"&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;, so there is no difference between the commands I use on Windows and those I use on Mac OS X or Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the examples, I'll use a few variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;USER=myusername
CVSROOT=:pserver:$USER@cvsserver:2401/cvsrepository
PROJECT=myprojectname
DROPBOX=mydropboxfolder
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;($DROPBOX refers to my &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE0Mzc3MDY5?src=global0"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; directory, where I keep all sorts of little files that I want synched to all my computers.  If you haven't looked at Dropbox, do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to get the CVS repository.  Git does have a &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cvsimport.html"&gt;git-cvsimport&lt;/a&gt; command that I could use to suck all the CVS stuff into a local Git repository, but the CVS repository is huge, so that would be very slow, and frankly, I don't really trust &lt;code&gt;git-cvsimport&lt;/code&gt;. So I just do what I would normally do to get stuff from CVS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cvs login
cd ~/work
cvs checkout $PROJECT
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, I set up the local Git repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cd ~/work/$PROJECT
git init
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The working directory contains a lot of files that I don't want or need to track with Git, so I've got a standard &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;CVS
.#*

.hg
.hgignore

bin
obj
Debug
Release
TestResults
*.obj
*.suo
*.ncb
*.user
*.tli
*.tlh
*.idb
*.pdb

build
*.pbxuser
*.perspectivev3
.DS_Store
xcuserdata

*.old
*.log
*.out
*.cache
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I just copy it from my Dropbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cp $DROPBOX/.gitignore .
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm ready to import everything into the Git repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git add .
git commit -m &amp;quot;Initial commit&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I keep a local tag &lt;code&gt;cvssync&lt;/code&gt; that indicates the last time that the Git and CVS repositories matched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git tag cvssync
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now I'm ready to do some work.  I always want the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; Git branch to match CVS, so I create a topic branch where I do my work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout -b develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After very efficiently and productively adding all the error-free code needed to implement whatever I'm implementing, I'm ready to commit on my &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git commit -am &amp;quot;Implemented the whosey-whatsit&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I tend to commit changes frequently. If I go more than an hour or so without a commit, I get worried.  The great thing about frequent commits is that it is easy to undo things.  The bad thing about frequent commits is that your commit history has lots and lots of entries, but as nobody is going to see that history but me, I don't worry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my boss calls and asks when the thing is going to be ready, and I tell him I'll check it into CVS right away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I quit Visual Studio or whatever editor(s) I'm using, because the next few operations will cause the contents of files to change, and IDE's often don't handle that gracefully. This step also ensures that I don't forget to save all my changed files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to merge the &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch back into the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout master
git merge develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, I pull in whatever changes others have added to CVS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cvs update -d
git commit -am &amp;quot;Sync with CVS&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I skip the &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; here if there were no changes from CVS.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I check what I've changed since the &lt;code&gt;cvssync&lt;/code&gt; tag, to remind myself and to verify it is right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git log cvssync..
cvs diff
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can push my changes to CVS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cvs commit -m &amp;quot;Implemented the whosey-whatsit&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My employer likes to put the &lt;code&gt;$Id$&lt;/code&gt; tag into source files, so after a &lt;code&gt;cvs commit&lt;/code&gt;, any committed files are going to have new identifiers, so I need to commit those changes to my &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git commit -am &amp;quot;Sync with CVS&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I update my &lt;code&gt;cvssync&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git tag -f cvssync
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If, while I'm doing my work, others check things into CVS, and I need those changes, here is what I generally do (after quitting Visual Studio):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git commit -am &amp;quot;Check in work branch&amp;quot;
git checkout master
cvs update -d
git commit -am &amp;quot;Pull from CVS&amp;quot;
git checkout develop
git rebase master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a lot of work, but it's saved me a couple of times already. I have some aliases and scripts that automate some of the steps, so my actual workflow is not as verbose as what I've written here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="git"></category><category term="cvs"></category></entry><entry><title>Core Animation Performance Tips</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/core-animation-performance-tips.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-18T10:36:44-04:00</published><updated>2010-05-18T10:36:44-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-05-18:/core-animation-performance-tips.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my copious free time, I've been working on a videogame for the iPad.

Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my personal projects …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my copious free time, I've been working on a videogame for the iPad. Friends and family may interject here that it seems like I'm &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; working on a videogame in my free time, but I've never actually finished one. This time is different. Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my personal projects are intended primarily to be interesting and fun for me. I gave myself a couple of technical constraints to keep things challenging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the code is well-factored idiomatic Objective-C. Unlike a lot of iPhone/iPad game programmers, I'm not writing all the guts in low-level C or C++ and then sprinkling a minimal amount of Cocoa on top to interface with the OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm using Core&amp;nbsp;Animation as my "engine", rather than the OpenGL ES API or an off-the-shelf gaming engine. (Note: My game only needs a couple dozen sprites.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, things have worked out well. I was worried that using Objective-C and Core&amp;nbsp;Animation might lead to performance issues on the iPad, but that hasn't been the case. I have run into a couple of issues with Core&amp;nbsp;Animation that were pretty easy to fix.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layer Creation Is Expensive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My game's "sprites" are just Core&amp;nbsp;Animation layers. When I initially implemented the game, I was creating layers and adding them to the view as needed, and then deleting them when they were no longer needed. This turned out to cause problems; a few frames would get dropped whenever a layer was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix for this was to create a pool of layers and add them all to the view at startup, and reuse those layers as needed. Unused layers get their &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt; property set false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watch Out for Misaligned Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run an app with Instruments with the Core Animation tool, it has an option to highlight "misaligned images." I couldn't find a lot of information on this, but apparently if you give layers positions that are not perfectly aligned to pixels, Core Animation does some anti-aliasing when rendering those layers, which degrades performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy fix is to just round all positions to whole pixels, via something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;- (void) setSpritePosition:(CGPoint)position {
    CGPoint alignedPosition;
    alignedPosition.x = floorf(0.5f + position.x);
    alignedPosition.y = floorf(0.5f + position.y);
    sprite.position = alignedPosition;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This got rid of most of my misaligned images, but I do still have some sprites that get rotated or scaled via a transform, and such images are always misaligned, unless they are rotated by some multiple of 90 degrees. Thankfully, I only have a few such sprites.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="performance"></category><category term="optimization"></category><category term="gamedevelopment"></category><category term="coreanimation"></category></entry><entry><title>My iPad Review</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/my-ipad-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-16T14:30:36-04:00</published><updated>2010-05-16T14:30:36-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-05-16:/my-ipad-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I've had an iPad for about a month and a half.

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it's really nice. It fills the need for a little Internet-connected device that lets me watch video, read books, read online news, and browse the web. I used to keep my old 13-inch MacBook next to the couch for these purposes, but that MacBook is now in a closet.  I've also put away my Sony Reader that I kept on the nightstand.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
I'm using it at work a lot more than I expected. My workstation has two monitors, but I find it handy to have programming documentation or technical books open on my iPad for reference. It essentially gives me a third monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take a lot of long car trips, and my wife really likes reading and web browsing with her 3G iPad in the passenger seat. It's a better experience than her MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad is not a replacement for a laptop. When I need to do a lot of typing, or switch back and forth between applications, then I put down the iPad and pick up my laptop. But picking up a laptop is starting to seem like a chore. The iPad is not heavy, it's not hot, it doesn't have a whirring fan, it doesn't require me to assume an uncomfortable posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a "computer," don't get an iPad: you'll be disappointed. Think of it more as a portable videogame console, or a Kindle on steroids. Saying that it is just a big iPhone is essentially correct, although many of the people who say that seemingly have no idea how useful a big iPhone could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad is heavier than I expected. This is usually not a problem, but when playing any of those accelerometer-based games for an extended period, my arms get tired. On the plus side, I guess this gives me some exercise that I've been missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the Amazon Kindle app for iPad more than I use iBooks. I like the fact that with Kindle, I'm not locked in to Apple-only platforms. iBooks is prettier than the Kindle app, but the Kindle app is good enough. I need to stress here that I am talking about the Kindle &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;iPad&lt;/em&gt;, not a Kindle device, which looks laughably archaic next to an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only real complaint about the iPad is lack of multitasking, but that should be addressed in a few months with a new iPhone OS revision. (I have the iPhone OS 4 beta on my phone, and really, really miss the new features when using my iPad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month-and-a-half I've had the iPad, there has only been one instance where I went to a web page that didn't work due to lack of Flash. So that's not really a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got the &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC361ZM/A"&gt;Apple iPad case&lt;/a&gt;. It is functional, but it is ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My iPad has survived one fall from a countertop to the floor, without any ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that some nice Android or Palm tablets appear soon. Competition and choice would be good, but right now, there is really no competitor to the iPad. It does what it does better than anything else can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, I'm excited by the new user-interface expectations being ushered in by the iPad. This will finally get us away from the 1984 Macintosh-style WIMP interfaces that we've been stuck with for so long. I don't like a lot of Apple's policies, but they are leading the way here, and other vendors will copy the good stuff, so we will all benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some must-try apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pandora-radio/id284035177?mt=8"&gt;Pandora Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Plug your iPad into the USB port and wait for iTunes to indicate it is connected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select your iPad in the Devices list in iTunes and click the Summary tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the word "Serial Number" next to the picture of your iPad. It will change to "Identifier (UDID)" and there will be a long string of letters and digits after it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Edit menu, choose the Copy command. (This will copy the letters and digits to the clipboard.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the UDID into an email to me, saying that you want to be a beta tester. If you don't know my email address, use the &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/contact"&gt;Contact Me&lt;/a&gt; form.&lt;/li&gt;

Most Internet problems are due to issues that have nothing …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the power goes out, nobody asks me how to make it work again. But if the Internet goes down for three seconds, everyone in the house is yelling at me, telling me I need to MAKE IT WORK! NOW!
&lt;!--break--&gt;
Most Internet problems are due to issues that have nothing to do with me. I don't have any magical Internet-fixing powers. I just calmly go through a few steps until everything works. Most often, the steps I take don't really fix anything. The Internet generally fixes itself, without any help from me, but family members yell at me less if it looks like I'm taking action. (My grouchy "leave me alone; I'm working" demeanor helps too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream: I would like to watch an entire episode of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; uninterrupted. I'm going to try to empower my family to "fix" these problems themselves, and I encourage others in my shoes to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/627/"&gt;xkcd Tech Support Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt;, here is the checklist that I plan to post next to each computer in the house. It's very simple; I don't expect anyone to check network settings, enter wi-fi passwords, or interpret blinking lights. It's really just a matter of turning things off and back on. Fill in the blanks as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Emergency Checklist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event that the Internet stops working, please take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remain calm. It may seem like the end of the world, but remember that this has already happened 83 times this year, and somehow we survived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly count to 100, then try whatever you were doing again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close all the web browser windows you have open (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Mozilla). Also close any other programs you know are using the Internet (e-mail, online games, Twitter clients, etc.). Wait 30 seconds, then open your web browser to see if your home page appears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reboot your computer, and try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check other computers in the house. If the Internet is working for them, but not on your computer, then turn off your computer, wait five minutes, turn it back on, wait five more minutes, and then try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the cable modem, the router, and your computer. The cable modem is the box that says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on it. The router is the box that says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on it. (If you can't find an on/off switch, just unplug the power cord.) Wait 60 seconds, then turn the cable modem back on. Wait 60 seconds, then turn the router back on. Wait 60 more seconds, then turn on your computer and try to do whatever you want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If things still don't work, you can ask for help from the resident tech support expert. If help isn't available, call the Internet service provider's tech support at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. When they ask for your phone number, don't give them your mobile phone number; give them the number associated with our account, which is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

I worked for a few years as an employee, and later as a contractor. Like all jobs, it's had its ups and downs, but on the whole it was a good experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have been happy to continue it, but a few weeks ago the company announced a "strategic partnership" with a European gaming company, with the intent of selling that other company's products in the US. That's probably good news for the company and its shareholders, but it's not good news for those of us who develop the products that are to be phased out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty clear we would eventually be laid off, but it wasn't clear when that would happen in a few weeks, a few months, or a few years. I started putting out feelers, hoping I'd be able to jump before getting pushed.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
Lucky for me, a former boss was enthusiastic about re-hiring me, and so I'm now back at &lt;a href="http://www.transcore.com/"&gt;TransCore&lt;/a&gt;, my first employer. Right now, I'm working as a contractor, but the plan is to go permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nice to see my former co-workers again. Their hair is a little grayer, but otherwise it doesn't seem much different from how it was when I left. They are still using the wiki I created. They are still using CVS (eeaagh!). The two guys who I hired are still working there. Code I wrote back in the early 1990's is still in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to working again with a team of people I like, but another big plus to this job is that I'll be able to do most of it from home. I live in Dahlonega, GA, which is about fifty miles north of where any Atlanta-area programming jobs are, so this is a very good thing. My boss and other team members work a lot from home too, so I won't be the oddball guy who seems to never be around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a Microsoft-heavy shop, so I'm having to re-learn a lot of the Windows development skills that I haven't used for a few years. Luckily (or unluckily), writing Win32 code with C++ hasn't changed much in the last decade, so I'm getting back up to speed in that area pretty quickly. I didn't do too much with .NET, but it looks like .NET has gotten a lot better during those years, so I'm looking forward to playing with that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope this works out. I'm done with the "switch jobs every few years to get a wide range of experience" part of my career, and want to find a place where I can do good work and have influence over the company's direction. This company has smart people who care about the quality of their work, and managers who put value on experience and talent. That's exactly the kind of place where I'd like to stay.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category></entry><entry><title>Shiny iPhone Buttons Without Photoshop</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/shiny-iphone-buttons-without-photoshop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-27T12:16:43-05:00</published><updated>2010-02-27T12:16:43-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-02-27:/shiny-iphone-buttons-without-photoshop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right;" src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/GradientButtonsAppScreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They quickly learn that they need a graphic artist to create a nice-looking button image in Photoshop and then attach that to the buttons. However, in this tutorial, I'll show how to create nice shiny buttons in code, without any image files, by using a &lt;code&gt;CAGradientLayer&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;Update (2010/5/20): Jeff LaMarche has posted code that is more capable than the code here, and I'd recommend taking a look at it.  See his &lt;a href="http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/05/improved-gradient-buttons.html"&gt;Improved Gradient Buttons&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*Update (2014/11/20): Note that with iOS 7 and later, shiny curvy buttons are no longer typical in iOS user interfaces. The code described below should still work, but consider using the standard iOS button appearance instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code can be downloaded here: &lt;a href="http://bitbucket.org/KristopherJohnson/gradientbuttons/get/tip.zip"&gt;gradientbuttons-tip.zip&lt;/a&gt;. It is also available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/gradientbuttons"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also follow along by looking at the source files in your web browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll start by laying out a view containing buttons. In Xcode, create a new View-based iPhone application, and call it "GradientButtons" (or whatever you want). Double-click the &lt;code&gt;GradientButtonsViewController.xib&lt;/code&gt; resource to open it in Interface&amp;nbsp;Builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag a UIButton control from the library onto the view. Set its properties like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the type to "Custom"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the title to "Gray"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the text color to white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the background color to gray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get fancy, you can also change the font, set the shadow, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For purposes of this tutorial, I then created several copies of this button, and set each to have a different background color and title. You can skip that if you just want to see what a single button looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the Interface Builder file, and then run the project in Xcode. It works, but where are those shiny buttons I promised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding the Shine Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give the buttons the glossy shine, we'll add a &lt;code&gt;CAGradientLayer&lt;/code&gt; overlay to each button. The overlay will be partially transparent, so the underlying text and background color will show through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a new class, &lt;code&gt;GradientButton&lt;/code&gt;, derived from &lt;code&gt;UIButton&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// GradientButton.h:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#import &amp;lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#import &amp;lt;QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GradientButton&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;CAGradientLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;CALayer&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first thing we want to do is give the button rounded corners and a border. This is easily done by setting the button's root layer's &lt;code&gt;cornerRadius&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;masksToBounds&lt;/code&gt; properties, and using a border color that is a transparent gray (so that the actual background color will show through).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;initBorder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;CALayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cornerRadius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;8.0f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;masksToBounds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;borderWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;borderColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithWhite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, we'll create the shine layer. All we need to do is create a &lt;code&gt;CAGradientLayer&lt;/code&gt;, set its frame to match the button's bounds, and set the &lt;code&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;locations&lt;/code&gt; properties to arrays of colors and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set the gradient colors and locations like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the top, pure white with 40% opacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the middle, pure white with 20% opacity, giving us a nice shine on the top half of the button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, switch to a medium gray with 20% opacity, making the bottom half of the button darker than the top half&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, at the very bottom, go back to pure white with 40% opacity to give the appearance of a little inner glow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I came up with these parameters after a lot of trial and error, to make the shine look good against all the background colors in my sample app. You will probably want to tweak them for the specific colors and overall look of your application. Make it shinier, make it flatter, give things a warm orangish glow rather than white, whatever. It's your app; do what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting those properties, we add the layer to the button's root layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;addShineLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;shineLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CAGradientLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;shineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;shineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;arrayWithObjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                         &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithWhite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                         &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithWhite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                         &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithWhite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.75f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                         &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithWhite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                         &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithWhite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                         &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;shineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;arrayWithObjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;numberWithFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;numberWithFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;numberWithFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;numberWithFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.8f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;numberWithFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;addSublayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that, because we are adding the layer as a sublayer, we don't need to &lt;code&gt;retain&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;shineLayer&lt;/code&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those methods written, now we just need to define an &lt;code&gt;awakeFromNib&lt;/code&gt; method so that they will be called when the buttons are loaded from the NIB. I also override &lt;code&gt;initWithFrame:&lt;/code&gt; so that my snazzy buttons can be created programmatically rather than being loaded from a NIB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;initLayers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;initBorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addShineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;awakeFromNib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;initLayers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;initWithFrame:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;initWithFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;initLayers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You'll need to add the &lt;code&gt;QuartzCore&lt;/code&gt; framework to your project to get it to link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing we need to do is go back to Interface&amp;nbsp;Builder and, for each button, go to the Identity inspector and change the class to &lt;code&gt;GradientButton&lt;/code&gt;, then save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that done, build and run the app. Now we have pretty buttons. However, if you press a button, nothing seems to happen. We need to highlight the button when it is touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Handling Touch Tracking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I told you to define the &lt;code&gt;GradientButton&lt;/code&gt; class, you may have noticed the &lt;code&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/code&gt; instance variable, and wondered what that was for. Well, here's the deal: when the user touches the button, we'll just show a layer that makes the button look highlighted, and when the user stops touching the button, we'll hide that layer. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we'll create a simple layer with a partially transparent gray color, set it to be hidden, and add it beneath the shine layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;addHighlightLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CALayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colorWithRed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.25f&lt;/span&gt;
                                                     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.25f&lt;/span&gt;
                                                      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.25f&lt;/span&gt;
                                                     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;CGColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;insertSublayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;below&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you don't like gray, change the color as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we override the &lt;code&gt;setHighlighted:&lt;/code&gt; method so that the highlight layer is displayed whenever the button is touched (or any other time its &lt;code&gt;highlighted&lt;/code&gt; property would be set true):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setHighlighted:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;highlight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;highlightLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;highlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setHighlighted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;highlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that because &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt; is an animatable property, the highlight will fade in and fade out smoothly during a transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to change our &lt;code&gt;initLayers&lt;/code&gt; method so that it calls &lt;code&gt;addHighlightLayer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;initLayers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;initBorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addShineLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addHighlightLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// added line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Run the app, and the buttons should light up when you touch them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But, Do the Buttons Actually Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to verify that our snazzy &lt;code&gt;GradientButton&lt;/code&gt; class hasn't somehow broken the basic button functionality, add an event-handler method to the &lt;code&gt;GradientButtonsViewController&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// GradientButtonsViewController.h:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#import &amp;lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GradientButtonsViewController&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;IBAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;colorButtonClicked:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The event handler will just set the view's background color to match the color of whatever button was clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// GradientButtonsViewController.m:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#import &amp;quot;GradientButtonsViewController.h&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@implementation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GradientButtonsViewController&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;IBAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;colorButtonClicked:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Set view&amp;#39;s background to match button color&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Go back to Interface Builder and wire up the buttons to the controller's &lt;code&gt;colorButtonClicked:&lt;/code&gt; handler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the app, and you should see the background change whenever you click a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exercises for the Reader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's basically it, but you can extend these ideas in a lot of ways. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;enabled&lt;/code&gt; property of the button gets set to false, you can "dim" the button by changing its opacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use another layer to handle the button becoming &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of using static layers, add some animation. For example, your shiny button could pulsate while idle, and grow slightly when touched.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version has a lot of cosmetic improvements over version 1.0. Version 1.0 was, frankly, a little embarrassing, and I'm glad I finally got around to fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created JacksOrBetter back in September 2008, when the App Store had only existed for a couple of months, and the iPhone App&amp;nbsp;Store Gold&amp;nbsp;Rush was on. The news was full of stories of iPhone developers who were making tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars from simple games. I wanted in on that action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JacksOrBetter wasn't intended to make me a fortune; it was my first learning-how-to-write-an-iPhone-app exercise. I figured I'd whip it out, learn what I needed to learn to make and sell an iPhone app, and then I'd get to work on the apps I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to write. (Those other apps are still in the conceptual stage, a year and a half later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, there were only a few hundred apps in the App Store, and many were little better than JacksOrBetter. I initially charged $1.99 for it, and after a couple of weeks dropped the price to $0.99. I made about $280 over the next few months. Initially I was selling a dozen or so copies per day, but sales eventually fell to only a few per week, so I decided to make it free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've seen a lot of really nice iPhone apps, and I've learned a lot more about how to make them, so I finally decided to sit down and make JacksOrBetter what it should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, it has nicer looking cards, a nicer background, and some cool animations of cards being dealt, discarded, and cleared at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still pretty simple, but it no longer has that first-app stink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few more changes I want to make, but I've got this idea for an iPad&amp;nbsp;app...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="jacksorbetter"></category><category term="iphone"></category></entry><entry><title>iPhone Sample Code: Tiles</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/iphone-sample-code-tiles.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-06T04:28:21-05:00</published><updated>2010-02-06T04:28:21-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-02-06:/iphone-sample-code-tiles.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an exercise in using the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Animation"&gt;Core Animation&lt;/a&gt; API, I've implemented a little iPhone app that reproduces the behavior of the iPhone home screen's icon reorganization interface.

(You know, dragging the wiggly icons around.) You can download my sample code to see how it works. Some descriptions of the highlights follow below.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/Tiles_Screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" style="float: right;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code and Xcode project can be downloaded here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/tilessample/zipball/master"&gt;tilessample&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source is also available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/tilessample"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary classes to look at are &lt;a href="http://github.com/kristopherjohnson/tilessample/blob/master/Classes/TilesViewController.m"&gt;&lt;code&gt;TilesViewController&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://github.com/kristopherjohnson/tilessample/blob/master/Classes/Tile.m"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The view controller implements all of the "logic" of the application, while the &lt;code&gt;Tile&lt;/code&gt; class has the animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instance of &lt;code&gt;Tile&lt;/code&gt; represents one of the icons, and is derived from &lt;code&gt;CAGradientLayer&lt;/code&gt;.  The gradient layer properties get set to provide a gloss effect for the tiles.  &lt;code&gt;Tile&lt;/code&gt; also provides a few animations, initiated by calling these methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;appearDraggable&lt;/code&gt;: Changes the tile to be partially transparent, and makes it slightly bigger. This is invoked when the user touches a tile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;appearNormal&lt;/code&gt;: Reverses the effects of &lt;code&gt;appearDraggable&lt;/code&gt;. This is invoked when the tile is released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;startWiggling&lt;/code&gt;: Starts a tile "wiggling", as in the iPhone home screen while in reorganization mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;stopWiggling&lt;/code&gt;: Stops the wiggling effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;TilesViewController&lt;/code&gt; class is pretty straightforward. When the user touches a the screen, the &lt;code&gt;touchesBegan&lt;/code&gt; method determines which tile was touched, calls its &lt;code&gt;appearDraggable&lt;/code&gt; method, and calls other tiles' &lt;code&gt;startWiggling&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the user drags the tile around the screen, the &lt;code&gt;touchesMoved&lt;/code&gt; method moves the dragged tile, and moves the other tiles as needed to provide an open space for it. Core Animation takes care of all the zooming around of the icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the user lets go of the tile, the &lt;code&gt;touchesEnded&lt;/code&gt; method drops it in place and removes all the animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I learned from this project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning on the &lt;code&gt;masksToBounds&lt;/code&gt; property for layers slows things down quite noticeably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When hit-testing layers, you have to use a layer's presentation layer, not a model layer itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAGradientLayer&lt;/code&gt; is easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I don't understand. (Maybe some smart person can explain.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When hit-testing to see which layer was touched, I had to do both &lt;code&gt;[touch locationInView:view]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[view convertPoint:location toView:nil]&lt;/code&gt;. However, when handling touch-moves, I only have to use &lt;code&gt;[touch locationInView:view]&lt;/code&gt;. I don't understand why the coordinate systems are (apparently) different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: 2012-04-16:&lt;/strong&gt; Changed the layer-initialization code so that it draws in high resolution on a Retina display. Updated the links above to point to GitHub.

A few friends and acquaintances accuse me of being stupid and easily fascinated by sparkly objects. Rather than have the same argument over and over again, I'm writing all my thoughts and predictions here. I will speak no further on the subject until I actually own an iPad.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
Whenever I am on my couch at home, I have a laptop computer with me. I browse the web while my wife watches her girly TV shows. I pay bills. I deal with email. I go to IMDB to figure out where I've seen that actor before. I get directions to wherever we're going. I write blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there is something wrong with me, but I've grown dependent on having that electronic link with the world at arm's reach. Even in bed, I often have my laptop with me, so that I can read or watch a video when insomnia strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the laptop is not ideal for the job. I don't like having a hot, heavy, vibrating hunk of metal in my lap. I don't like the fan noise. I don't like the need to open it when I want it and close it when putting it aside. I don't like backing up the humongous hard drive. A trackpad is not a good substitute for a mouse. I don't like the need to memorize all the shortcut keys to be productive without a mouse. I don't like it when the dogs walk over the keyboard and mess things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more, I reach for my iPhone instead of my laptop, but the iPhone's tiny display has obvious limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, an iPad would fill a real need &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt; (using a First World definition of &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;). It looks like a tool that will let me browse the web, read, watch video, etc., without all the unnecessary clunkiness of a laptop. Believe it or not, I wanted something like this before Lord Jobs told me I wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don' t have that need, fine. I'm not trying to sell you anything. I'm just explaining why &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; would like to have an iPad, or something like it. (And there is currently nothing else like it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe a lot of other people will want one too. There are people like me who want the couch/bed experience. Anyone who has tried to use a laptop on an airplane will appreciate how much better the iPad would be for that situation. There will be people who want to take something to school, the library, or the coffee shop without lugging a laptop case around. The iPad will be a much better notebook than a "notebook computer".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, an iPad will not be a good product. If you do a lot of writing and editing of text, iPad probably won't be a great thing. If you want to quickly switch among multiple applications, iPad probably won't be a great thing. If you need Microsoft Office or Photoshop or some other specific desktop application, iPad probably won't be a great thing. If you don't have a few hundred dollars of disposable income, iPad probably won't be a great thing. But that's OK&amp;mdash;nobody is requiring you to replace your laptop with an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iPad won't do everything a laptop does. It's not &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to do everything a laptop does. The relationship between iPad and laptop is similar to the relationship between a microwave oven and a set of pots, pans, and cooking utensils. The pots, pans, and cooking utensils can produce more satisfying meals than the microwave can, but often you just don't want to drag all that stuff out and clean up afterward. A microwave is a good complement to a well-equipped kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember back when all of our moms and grandparents suddenly started buying computers? It was because they wanted to use the web and e-mail. That's still all that most of them do. They don't care about multi-tasking or writing their own software or enterprise integration. They shouldn't have had to learn the differences between left-click and right-click and double-click and control-click and shift-click. The iPad is what they needed back then. The iPad is what the original Mac was, thirty years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot I don't like about the iPad (What? The ultimate fanboy has criticisms?). Apple's locked-down control of the platform is definitely a problem. The iPad doesn't support a lot of functionality that it obviously should (multitasking, use of network printers, and so on), and Apple's policies prevent third-party developers from providing such functionality. The media DRM can be frustrating, but I think the content providers deserve more of the blame for that than Apple does. Objective-C is a relic from the 1980's, and Apple's development tools haven't really improved since they were NeXT's development tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't run Flash, but that doesn't bother me. While I do think it would be a more useful device if it did, and users should be able to install whatever crap software they'd like, I think websites that require Flash are like websites that require Internet Explorer 6. If Apple is hastening the day when we all laugh at such sites, than I applaud them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have a camera. So what? A computer needs a camera like a fish needs a bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding multi-tasking: I actually like the idea of having a single app running at a time. That fits my own preferences for using my laptop; I often use the "Hide Others" menu item to minimize distractions. It annoys me when I have to open Activity Monitor to figure out which app is using 200% CPU. However, it would be really nice if Pandora or instant messengers could run in the background. If Apple won't give us full multitasking, I hope they will at least provide some sort of support for third-party background tasks in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to some predictions. I do think Apple has created a new product category. Notice that every new smartphone looks a lot like an iPhone? The same is going to happen in this market segment. I think you'll see the netbook and e-reader markets shrink, and more vendors will provide things that look like the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope a strong competitor emerges, because we need choice. Apple is first out of the gate, and as with the iPhone, it will take a while before anyone else produces anything with the level of polish needed to be considered an alternative. The surprisingly low price is going to give Apple a pretty big user base pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong competitor won't be a Windows-based machine. Microsoft still thinks everything, from the smallest smartphone to the biggest enterprise server, should have a desktop-style Windows UI, with all of its complexity and anachronisms. Apple was very smart to base the iPad on the iPhone UI, rather than on Mac OS X UI. The consistency of Windows- and Mac OS-style UIs was a great thing 20 years ago, when people were first learning about personal computers, but experience with smartphones and videogame systems shows that people can pick up different UIs quickly, without need for a mouse, windows, menus, and other such things. UIs can and should be designed specifically for each different type of appliance, but Microsoft is going to keep giving us the Windows&amp;nbsp;95 UI everywhere. So we're going to see a lot of tablet-pad knockoffs that run Windows&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;Basic, and they will all suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting a desktop-style OS on iPad-style hardware is not a solution. Cool as the iPad hardware is, it's the OS that makes it what it is. If your OS is designed for a keyboard and mouse, then you are not competing with the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone will make a good Android-based alternative, or maybe Google's Chrome OS on iPad-like hardware will work. Maybe someone will make Ubuntu touch-friendly. I'm doubtful, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say that the iPhone and iPad are the first steps on a path to a world where we will all be limited to using locked-down narrow-use devices, and nobody will have access to an open platform. I can't see this happening. Buying an iPad doesn't require you to turn your laptop in to the authorities. You can continue to do everything you could do before you had an iPad. There will always be Google, Microsoft, Linux, and/or other alternatives available if Apple does to its computers what it has done with its mobile devices. And more of our applications and data are going to live in The Cloud rather than on our devices, so it won't matter what rules the devices follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years from now, I think the computers we use will look a lot more like the iPad than like the Macbook or a Wintel laptop, both in terms of hardware and software. Apple may not dominate the industry then, but the heritage will be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hop on the bandwagon now, or wait and hop on later. I don't care what you do. I'm not ashamed of being an early hopper.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category><category term="ipad"></category></entry><entry><title>43</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/43.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-01-17T01:46:13-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-17T01:46:13-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-01-17:/43.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another year older.

About a week and half ago, Boo gave birth to a puppy whom we've named &lt;em&gt;Sparky&lt;/em&gt;. He hasn't opened his eyes yet, but he's growing fast. So we now have four dogs, which is more than we really want, but I doubt we'll be able to part with any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lost thirty pounds this year. I'd like to lose another twenty, but I'm glad I haven't regained what I've lost. As a result of the weight loss and diet, I no longer need medication to control hypertension or cholesterol. So I'm healthier than I was last year, and I hope that trend continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife decided to put a patio in the backyard this summer. The project grew a little beyond its initial scope, but the result is that we have a really nice backyard now. I like to go out there and read on weekends. It makes our little house feel a little bigger. I still really like it in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlonega,_Georgia"&gt;Dahlonega&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice in my "42" entry that I said my career was in a rut, and it still is. However, I will have some opportunity to learn new things at work this year, so while it's still not what I want, at least it won't be completely boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually when I write my birthday blog post, I can review the last year's worth of blog postings to remind me of the things I did during the year. Unfortunately, this year I decided to limit my blog postings to programming- and technology-related topics, so I don't have a record of the really interesting things that have happened. But I do know that I'm happy, and that's all that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category><category term="birthday"></category></entry><entry><title>Objectified: Great Documentary</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/objectified-great-documentary.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-01-16T02:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-16T02:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2010-01-16:/objectified-great-documentary.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished watching &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/"&gt;Objectified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and can wholeheartedly recommend it to audiences of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often think that consumerism and mass production takes the human element out of life, but &lt;em&gt;Objectified&lt;/em&gt; will make you look at all those little works of art that surround us. Sure, there may be ten million copies of each thing, made by people in sweatshops, but somewhere there was a person who thought about it and made a lot of decisions. What shape should it be? What color should it be? What texture should it have? Should the edges be sharp or rounded? What should it be made of? How will it be manufactured? How much will people pay for it? What should the packaging look like? How can it be disposed of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectified&lt;/em&gt; presents interviews with the people who do that. It may be a little geeky (how many people really care?), but it will give you a new appreciation for all that stuff you buy.&lt;/p&gt;

It should work on any decent web browser (that is, one that has good implementations of JavaScript and CSS2). It uses a few WebKit-specific features, so it looks a little better on Safari and Google Chrome than it does on Firefox and Internet&amp;nbsp;Explorer. It doesn't require Flash or Java; it's just plain-old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd rather control it with the keyboard then by clicking buttons, you can use the space bar to deal/draw, and you can use the numeric keys 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to specify which cards to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing a jacks-or-better poker game is my standard exercise for learning a new programming language or development platform. It is simple, without being trivial. The user interface can be very simple or very complex, depending upon my mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this app is basically functional now, there are still a lot of features and refinements to be added. For example, I need to show a payout table. The animations could also use improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this app works fine in a desktop browser, I'm really targeting it at the iPhone and similar platforms. Right now, it is a bit sluggish on iPhone. I'm going to start playing with &lt;a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/"&gt;jQTouch&lt;/a&gt; to give it more of a native-app feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nifty feature that does work on the iPhone is that, after initial loading from the web, it can be run while offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to hear how well it works on Android and Palm Pre. It works on the emulators, but I don't have actual devices to test.

&lt;p&gt;Despite fearful rhetoric to the contrary, terrorism is not a transcendent threat. A terrorist attack cannot possibly destroy a country's way of life; it's only our reaction to that attack that can do that kind of damage. The more we undermine our own laws, the more we convert our buildings into fortresses, the more we reduce the freedoms and liberties at the foundation of our societies, the more we're doing the terrorists' job for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Correspond with people. This doesn't mean forwarding e-mail jokes, posting your status on a web page, or ranting about what some politician has done. You need to write about meaningful things, and carefully read what others have written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine your beliefs. How did you get them? What are they based on? Do they still make sense to you? Can you imagine what it would be like to hold different beliefs? Talk to someone who does have different beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usually easy to debunk such claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the story been reported or repeated by any reputable news sources? If not, be skeptical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try Googling the first sentence or two of the story. This often brings up pages that demonstrate the story to be a hoax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try searching websites like http://snopes.com/, http://www.factcheck.org/, and http://skeptoid.com/ that have smart people who investigate suspicious claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some stories, the tiniest bits of critical thinking and research and should quickly lead to the conclusion that they are bogus. But it amazes me that people accept these stories without even &lt;em&gt;considering&lt;/em&gt; that they may be untrue. Their "bullshit detectors" just don't work. They accept any negative story about people they don't like, and any positive story about people they do like. They reject mainstream media and other reputable sources in favor of quacks, cranks, and conspiracy theorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to accept stories without question if they fit your existing beliefs, but we must always be on guard against such acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.

When I was a kid, and got my first computer, I spent a lot of time typing in the programs from David Ahl's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/"&gt;BASIC Computer Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. After typing in the code for the games and playing them a bit, I'd start changing them. Eventually, I got into 6502 assembly language and higher-level programming languages, but that early exposure to a bunch of simple BASIC programs is what got me started as a coder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, kids are surrounded by programmable computers, but few of them learn how to write code. Most kids are no more interested in programming a computer than they would be in rebuilding a car's engine. I don't see a lot of simple projects like those in Ahl's book that they can play with and start hacking on. How does a kid get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are programming environments that are intended to teach kids programming (&lt;a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/"&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.alice.org/"&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). But use of those is not widespread, and I question their usefulness. All the good programmers I know started with something primitive, like BASIC, Fortran, Perl, or command.com. I wonder if somebody can really learn how computers work by working with fancy 3D "authoring environments" like Alice and Squeak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's occurred to me that web applications might be one way to get into programming. Web browsers are as ubiquitous as BASIC was in the 80's. It's relatively easy for a kid to set up a web site with Drupal or some other off-the-shelf CMS, and then start customizing it. All they need is Notepad and an Internet connection. They learn a little CSS here, a little JavaScript there, and pretty soon they'd rather be coding than playing games. &lt;/p&gt;

I learned C++ before any of my colleagues did, and knew more about its intricacies than they did. I implemented ActiveX control containers before most people knew what "ActiveX" or "COM" was. I dug into CORBA. I played around with Java 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I liked being an expert on new stuff. I enjoyed being on the bleeding edge. I liked being able to answer everyone's questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now I find myself on the other side of things. I'm bringing myself up to speed on some relatively "old" stuff: Java, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It sometimes feels like I'm the only person who doesn't already know this stuff, and I'm not comfortable being the newbie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are benefits to jumping on the bandwagon late. For example, JavaScript actually works now, and most people have browsers with decent implementations of DOM and CSS. A lot of that J2EE silliness has quietly faded away. I can take advantage of lots of libraries written by experienced people, and there are plenty of people who can answer my questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I'm nagged by the feeling that I'm &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt;, and won't ever be able to be one of the foremost experts or significant contributors to the communities. Maybe someday I'll be mature enough to accept that, but I'm not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Are Web Developers Real Programmers?</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/are-web-developers-real-programmers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-09T13:23:01-05:00</published><updated>2009-12-09T13:23:01-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-12-09:/are-web-developers-real-programmers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/11/25/native-apps-vs-web-apps"&gt;native-vs.-webapp hubbub&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of weeks ago got me thinking about why "web developers" are looked down upon by "real programmers."

&lt;!--break--&gt;
I'll admit that I've held that prejudice myself. I looked at client-side web development back in the mid 1990's and decided that it wasn't for me. The web browsers of the time were primitive, and every one acted differently. The situation was a big mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned to be a programmer back in the days when, if you read the programming language manual, the operating system manual, and the library manual, then you could actually write code and expect it to work the first time you ran it. The machine was your servant. If the code you wrote didn't work, it was probably because you had screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, programming for web browsers requires a lot of experimentation, guesswork, vendor-specific APIs, and hacky workarounds. The code one wrote usually didn't work the first time, no matter how smart and careful the author was. The browser held a lot of secrets, and thus was the master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could any &lt;em&gt;real programmer&lt;/em&gt; get involved in technology that mostly didn't work, and had no formal specifications nor complete documentation? This led to my belief that all the people writing scripts for browsers and calling them "applications" were merely programmer-wanna-bes. They may have been able to hack things together, but they didn't have that &lt;em&gt;real programmer&lt;/em&gt; mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, things have changed a lot since then. Google Maps was the web application that made a lot of us wake up and notice that browsers weren't just HTML displayers any more. AJAX took hold as an "enterprise technology." Still, a lot of us old-timers continued to consider JavaScript to be a toy language, and the many incompatibilities between browsers meant it still could not be considered a stable platform for serious programming. And any user interface platform that doesn't have a standard graphics API is just pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, to be completely honest, I was just too lazy to learn more about it, and I was making my living by writing native applications. It was all too easy to just dismiss it as something not worth wasting time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've spent a couple of weeks with JavaScript and related stuff, I've changed my mind. One can be a real programmer with JavaScript. It's actually a pretty cool little language, incorporating aspects of Scheme and Self. What makes JavaScript programming a mess is cross-browser incompatibility and the fact that most JavaScript is just cut-and-pasted by people who don't know what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsers have come a long way too. It used to be that you could create a sophisticated UI only by implementing a Java applet (yuck) or using Flash (yuck). &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5"&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt; is finally making it possible for web developers to &lt;em&gt;draw things on the screen&lt;/em&gt; (!!!) without resorting to such madness. Web browsers now provide a platform similar to what personal computers provided twenty years ago. It's taken a while, but there are no more excuses for dismissing the web browser as a primitive toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's now pretty easy for someone to create a slick website by installing Drupal, Joomla, Zope, or something similar, and then customizing it for a client's needs. However, the people who do that are not &lt;em&gt;real programmers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes a &lt;em&gt;real programmer&lt;/em&gt; from all the rest of the people who can create a web site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you write your own HTML and CSS, or do you just use prepackaged themes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you write your own JavaScript code, or do you just cut-and-paste snippets you find via Google?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you read and write JavaScript, or do you have to rely on some higher-level abstraction (Google Web Toolkit, Cappucino, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When something doesn't work, can you debug and fix it, or do you just have to throw it away and try something else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you refer to the official specs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or do you just make a lot of guesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you try to write portable code and adhere to standards, or are you happy with whatever works for 80% of your users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you design, develop, and test your code in modular fashion, or just throw the whole mess together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you adhere to coding standards and try to write code that is readable and maintainable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about the code you write?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, can you create your own software components, or can you only glue together components created by others? If you're a creator, then you're a &lt;em&gt;real programmer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Quick-and-Dirty Guide to QUnit</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/quick-and-dirty-guide-qunit.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-06T22:07:52-05:00</published><updated>2009-12-06T22:07:52-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-12-06:/quick-and-dirty-guide-qunit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm playing around with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; in my spare time, and have started creating a web app. As I usually do, particularly when learning something new, I am using a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"&gt;test-driven development&lt;/a&gt; approach.

I looked at a few JavaScript unit-testing frameworks, and decided to go with &lt;a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit"&gt;QUnit&lt;/a&gt;, the testing framework used by the jQuery project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QUnit isn't too hard to set up or use, but my unfamiliarity with JavaScript, jQuery, and related things meant it took a little more work than it should have. A few out-of-date QUnit tutorials on the web made things worse. So, here is a quick-and-dirty QUnit tutorial that might be helpful for others who are the same boat that I was in.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Download Library Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to download jQuery and the two files that make up QUnit. Here are the links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;jquery.js&lt;/a&gt; (Click the big &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt; button on the right side of that page.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/jquery/qunit/raw/master/qunit/qunit.js"&gt;qunit.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/jquery/qunit/raw/master/qunit/qunit.css"&gt;qunit.css&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; When you download jQuery, you'll end up with a file called &lt;code&gt;jquery-1.3.2.min.js&lt;/code&gt;, or something like that. I rename it to &lt;code&gt;jquery.js&lt;/code&gt; to keep things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll put all three files into the directory where the JavaScript code is going to be. Of course, in real life you can put them wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Production Code to be Tested&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will need some JavaScript code to test. Some poor confused souls put their JavaScript code and tests in their HTML files, but we're going to do things The Right Way and put the production code and the test code into their own files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our production module, &lt;code&gt;calculator.js&lt;/code&gt;, which provides sophisticated mathematical functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;// calculator.js

var Calculator = function () {
    this.add      = function (a, b) { return a + b; };
    this.subtract = function (a, b) { return a - b; };
    this.multiply = function (a, b) { return a * b; };
    this.divide   = function (a, b) { return a / b; };
};
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Test Cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our tests, in &lt;code&gt;calculator_tests.js&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;// calculator_tests.js

Calculator.runTests = function () {

    test(&amp;quot;add&amp;quot;, function () {
        var c = new Calculator();
        equals(c.add(1, 1), 2, &amp;quot;1 + 1&amp;quot;);
        equals(c.add(2, 2), 4, &amp;quot;2 + 2&amp;quot;);
    });

    test(&amp;quot;subtract&amp;quot;, function () {
        var c = new Calculator();
        equals(c.subtract(1, 1), 0, &amp;quot;1 - 1&amp;quot;);
        equals(c.subtract(100, 1), 99, &amp;quot;100 - 1&amp;quot;);
    });

    test(&amp;quot;multiply&amp;quot;, function () {
        var c = new Calculator();
        equals(c.multiply(1, 1), 1, &amp;quot;1 * 1&amp;quot;);
        equals(c.multiply(2, 2), 4, &amp;quot;2 * 2&amp;quot;);
        equals(c.multiply(17, 23), 391, &amp;quot;17 * 23&amp;quot;);
    });

    test(&amp;quot;divide&amp;quot;, function () {
        var c = new Calculator();
        equals(c.divide(1, 1), 1, &amp;quot;1 / 1&amp;quot;);
        equals(c.divide(8, 2), 4, &amp;quot;8 / 2&amp;quot;);
        equals(c.divide(1, 0), Infinity, &amp;quot;1 / 0&amp;quot;);
    });
};
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here, I've made my test function a member of the module I'm testing, but you can define it however you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit#API_documentation"&gt;QUnit API documentation&lt;/a&gt; for info about the test functions. All you need to know to understand the above is that &lt;code&gt;test(name, function)&lt;/code&gt; creates a test case, and &lt;code&gt;equals(actual, expected, message)&lt;/code&gt; checks equivalence of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HTML Test Runner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need an HTML file, &lt;code&gt;calculator_tests.html&lt;/code&gt;, which loads all the modules, runs the tests, and displays the results in a web browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Load jQuery and QUnit --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;jquery.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;qunit.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;qunit.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;media=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;screen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Load modules to be tested --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;calculator.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;calculator_tests.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This jQuery fragment calls Calculator.runTests() after the document loads --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
    Calculator.runTests();    
});
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- QUnit will put the results in the elements here --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;qunit-header&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Calculator Tests&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;qunit-banner&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;qunit-userAgent&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;qunit-tests&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With all those files in place, just open &lt;code&gt;calculator_tests.html&lt;/code&gt; in a web browser, and it will show the results. Successful tests will be green, and failed tests will be red. You can click the individual tests to get detailed lists of the assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's it. Read the QUnit docs, and start writing some tests.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tutorial"></category><category term="qunit"></category><category term="jquery"></category><category term="javascript"></category><category term="unittesting"></category></entry><entry><title>Stack Overflow Careers</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/stack-overflow-careers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-06T14:38:08-05:00</published><updated>2009-12-06T14:38:08-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-12-06:/stack-overflow-careers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finding a good job, or finding good employees, has always sucked.

&lt;p&gt;What differentiates Stack Overflow Careers from all the other job-board web sites is that candidates' CV's are linked to their Stack Overflow accounts, so an employer can get a feel for how smart a person is by checking their SO reputation and reading their questions and answers. They are also trying to avoid a lot of the annoyances that plague other job-search sites. It is also hoped that the association with Stack Overflow will attract the best candidates and employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've set up my CV: http://careers.stackoverflow.com/kristopherjohnson. The process was pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs $29 to enter your CV into the employee-search database, and employers have to pay a pretty steep price to search it. I think that's a good thing; it keeps things serious. (Note: You can create a public CV for free, but it won't show up in employer's searches.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not actively looking for a job, but if anyone wants to pay me huge gobs of money to play with cool stuf, I'm definitely available.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="career"></category></entry><entry><title>Not Quite NaNoWriMo Review</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/not-quite-nanowrimo-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-01T10:38:23-05:00</published><updated>2009-12-01T10:38:23-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-12-01:/not-quite-nanowrimo-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month, I &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/11/01/not-quite-nanowrimo"&gt;committed to do a lot of writing&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;So, I didn't really meet either commitment, but I'm OK with that.

&lt;p&gt;Why? Firefox is just too slow. Remember the good old days when Firefox was the leaner, faster, less-bloated alternative to Netscape Navigator? Those days are in the past. Firefox now takes over ten seconds to show a window after I launch it, whereas Safari is up immediately. Safari is also faster at rendering pages, and at just about everything else. It takes up a fraction of the memory of Firefox, and has not yet started using 100% CPU for no reason at all, as Firefox tends to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that Firefox has that other browsers can't match is the huge set of add-ons (extensions, themes, etc.). While many of these are really cool, there are really only two that I consider must-haves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/"&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/469"&gt;PasswordMaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of Adblock Plus is noticeable right away. Web sites that I visit frequently are suddenly awash in ads. It's very distracting. There are a couple of Safari extensions that supposedly work like Adblock Plus on Firefox, but they don't work as well. Most Safari users seem to be happy with simply blocking Flash ads with &lt;a href="http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/"&gt;ClickToFlash&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm not satisfied with that. I've just started a trial of &lt;a href="http://glimmerblocker.org/"&gt;GlimmerBlocker&lt;/a&gt;, which seems pretty good so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PasswordMaker is a nifty little Firefox extension that automatically fills in password fields with passwords that are unique to each site, generated by hashing a master password with the site's name. This is great, because I haven't had to remember any passwords with Firefox, but it's bad in that I now have to teach Safari all those passwords, and I have to do a lot of manual copying and pasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my new foray into web technologies, maybe I'll devote some time to trying to get these essential Firefox extensions ported over to Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the missing add-ons, I also miss Firefox's &lt;a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1005889"&gt;keyword search&lt;/a&gt; functionality. There is a Safari extension, &lt;a href="http://alexstaubo.github.com/keywurl/"&gt;Keywurl&lt;/a&gt;, that supposedly provides this functionality, but it is not yet compatible with Snow Leopard. (If you search hard enough, however, you can find some unofficial 64-bit builds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Safari does not actually have a supported plug-in/extension mechanism, so most of these extensions are hacks that can crash Safari or which suddenly stop working whenever there is a system update. It's a shame that so many products today are not designed to be extensible or user-programmable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from those little missing features, I'm happy with Safari. (For now, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="web"></category><category term="safari"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="firefox"></category></entry><entry><title>JavaScript: The Good Parts</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/javascript-good-parts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-29T21:57:34-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-29T21:57:34-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-29:/javascript-good-parts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a result of the recent &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/11/25/native-apps-vs-web-apps"&gt;hubbub about web apps&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to get myself up to speed on JavaScript and CSS.

&lt;p&gt;It's a good book. The basic idea is that while JavaScript is actually a pretty cool little programming language, it has a lot of features that are best not used, and it has many outright flaws, so Crockford presents a recommended subset of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most valuable parts of the book are appendices A and B, entitled "Awful Parts" and "Bad Parts", respectively. These appendices list the gotchas of JavaScript and present rationale for leaving certain constructs out of the recommended subset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only gripe with the book is that, while it is presented as an introductory book, it seems to assume some previous knowledge and experience with JavaScript. I got a bit lost in some parts, particularly those regarding prototypes, the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and how &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; gets bound in various situations. (I was able to eventually figure these things out with a bit of Googling.) It also assumes some experience with functional programming, which is OK with me, but which will probably confuse a lot of introductory readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I can enthusiastically recommend the book, I think I'd recommend it as a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; JavaScript book.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="review"></category><category term="javascript"></category><category term="book"></category></entry><entry><title>The Houben Case and Facilitated Communication</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/houben-case-and-facilitated-communication.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-26T10:08:20-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-26T10:08:20-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-26:/houben-case-and-facilitated-communication.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The media has been reporting that a Belgian man who has been in a coma for 23 years is now able to communicate thanks to "assistance" from an aide who holds his hand while he types on a keyboard (or actually, while &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; type on a keyboard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;
The furor started with Peter-Paul Koch's profanity-laden rant entitled &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/11/apple_is_not_ev.html"&gt;"Apple is not evil. iPhone developers are stupid."&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, PPK asserts that most iPhone applications could easily have been implemented as web applications rather than as native apps that have to be downloaded from the App Store, but iPhone developers are just too stupid to take advantage of web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPK obviously has a chip on his shoulder over the fact that web developers are not given the same respect as "real programmers", but he did raise some good points. There are a lot of simple form-based iPhone apps that could easily have been done as web apps, thus avoiding entanglements with Apple's review process and also providing compatibility with platforms other than the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, PPK was also wrong on several points. He overestimated the capabilities of the iPhone's mobile browser; many of the things he thought could be done in-browser really can't be (yet). He also completely ignored two major benefits of native apps: they look nicer and developers have an easy way to get paid for making them. Cocoa developers have &lt;a href="http://farukat.es/journal/2009/11/347-iphone-developers-arent-stupid-ppk"&gt;many good reasons&lt;/a&gt; for choosing the Cocoa Touch framework over web technologies, even in cases where a web app could compare well to a native app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPK has backpedaled a bit, and his follow-up posts have been a little more reasonable and balanced than the original. But other iPhone developers have jumped on the bandwagon, pointing out that maybe too many Cocoa developers really are just too lazy and arrogant to &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/"&gt;learn enough about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make web apps for iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy iPhone web-app industry would lead to interoperability with Android and other mobile platforms, and would loosen Apple's stranglehold on its platform. Unfortunately, there is no App Store for iPhone web apps, so they can be hard to find. Apple does have a &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/"&gt;web apps page&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of links to web apps, but most iPhone users have no idea that it exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit ironic, because in the early days of the iPhone, Apple was telling developers that web apps were the way to go, and there was no need for a native SDK. At that time, most developers scoffed. Developers wanted to create high-performance games and apps that looked as nice as the built-in apps (Mail, Contacts, Google Maps, etc), and those things could not be done as web apps. And there is a lot of truth to the idea that "real programmers" look down on web development as an activity for those not smart enough to learn C, and see web apps as toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, thanks to PPK's nudge, a few influential iPhone developers have started talking about web technologies. As a proof-of-concept, there is the game &lt;a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/257187093/pie-guy"&gt;Pie Guy&lt;/a&gt; by Neven Mrgan, which is a web application but which acts a lot like a native app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other iPhone developers have started talking about the &lt;a href="http://cappuccino.org/"&gt;Cappucino Web Framework&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source framework that allows one to use an API that is very similar to the Mac Cocoa frameworks. In this way, Cocoa developers can write iPhone web apps without having to learn too much (an approach which I don't like, but which has some merit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself have wanted to spend more time learning the ins and outs of JavaScript, CSS, and the DOM, but I've never had a "real project" that forced me to do so. Maybe it's time to find one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="webdev"></category><category term="iphone"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Android: Maybe Not</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/android-maybe-not.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-25T06:01:49-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-25T06:01:49-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-25:/android-maybe-not.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I said I was considering &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/11/19/switching-away-apple"&gt;giving up on iPhone development and trying Android instead&lt;/a&gt;.

Here are my further thoughts along those lines.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
First, I downloaded the Android SDK, did a little reading, and went through the &lt;em&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/em&gt; tutorial to bring up an app in the Android simulator. I didn't go too far beyond that. The Android SDK is all based on Java and XML, which are two things I don't like much, but on the whole it looked like a reasonable set of tools and software frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to Best Buy to play with a &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/30/motorola-droid-review/"&gt;DROID&lt;/a&gt; phone. They had a nonfunctional "dummy" phone on display, and the dummy phone was terrible: it was flimsy and cheap, and the keyboard was too stiff to be usable. I was about to just give up right there. But, while my wife ooh'ed over a Sony Reader Touch, I asked a salesperson if they had any actual DROID phones, and when told that they did, I asked to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have much to add to all the other DROID reviews you can find on the net. It looks really nice. It feels really nice. It doesn't have the smooth curves of the iPhone, but the hardware is definitely impressive. The software didn't look as nice as the iPhone, but it looked usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with those two basic "Would Android use and development suck?" questions tentatively answered &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;, I started doing some investigation of the Android software market. And that is where I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a complete description of everything wrong with the Android software market, see AppleInsider's "&lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/11/21/inside_googles_android_and_apples_iphone_os_as_software_markets.html"&gt;Inside Google's Android and Apple's iPhone OS as software markets&lt;/a&gt;". Here's a summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android users don't buy as many apps as iPhone and iPod touch users do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android phones don't have much storage space available for installation of apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The apps in the Android Market are what you would expect for an open-source platform: functional-but-ugly stuff written by hobbyists, no commercial-grade productivity apps or name-brand games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The variety of Android devices and software versions make it difficult to create apps that work on all phones, or even on large subsets of phones. (This is similar to the problems of Windows Mobile development.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google is doing little to promote the Android Market to users or to encourage serious developers to put apps there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a negative feedback loop at play. Nobody wants to buy Android apps, because nobody makes good Android apps, and nobody wants to make good apps, because nobody buys them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line may be that people who are willing to spend money on their mobile devices are going to buy the Apple products. The people who buy Android phones are going to be members of one of these three camps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those who just want a functional phone, and don't care about the OS or third-party apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those who would really like an iPhone, but can't afford one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those who would really like an iPhone, but have philosophical objections to giving money to Apple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Android users aren't the kind of people who spend money on nice apps. So they aren't going to get any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most optimistic spin I could put on this situation was "Well, if there are no good apps there, then if I make the first awesome Android app, then every Android user will buy it and I'll make lots of money." But that doesn't seem reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another optimistic spin is "Well, there won't be any consumer apps, but there may be a lot of custom app development. For example, give all your salespeople Android phones with your company's CRM app installed." That may be true, but I don't want to get into that business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm going to stick with iPhone development for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not saying that Android is going to "fail." I think device makers will be dropping Windows Mobile, Symbian, and other OSes in favor of Android, so we'll be seeing a lot of Android devices. But I don't see an iPhone App Store-style success. There will be apps for Android, but they won't be the reason to buy an Android phone. Better to be in the Android ringtone business, I think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Deal on Photoshop Elements 8</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/deal-photoshop-elements-8.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-25T00:41:09-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-25T00:41:09-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-25:/deal-photoshop-elements-8.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're one of the people (like me) who needs to occasionally do some image editing, but who doesn't want to spend a few hundred bucks on Photoshop, you may want to check out Photoshop Elements 8.&lt;/p&gt;

I find myself drawn back to Windows on my desktop, and to an Android mobile device.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
There was a time that the Macintosh was clearly superior to the competition in every way except price. But that was a while ago. Now, the Mac is still pretty nice, but choosing Mac over Windows is a matter of preference rather than necessity. Ironically, Windows is now the operating system for the everyman, where everything just works, while Mac OS X is the one that requires a lot of technical expertise and hackish workarounds to get anything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone created a new product category, and is still the clear leader of that category. If I was just a consumer, I'd stick with the iPhone. But I'm a software developer, and developing software for the iPhone isn't the joy I'd hoped it would be. The tools are archaic and quirky, and with 100,000 apps in the App Store, it is practically impossible to get anyone to notice your work. Apple just doesn't need me, and doesn't act like it wants me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I find myself drawn back to Windows on my desktop, and to an Android mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a few years since I've done any serious Windows development, and I need to brush up on those skills. I want to buy a copy of Windows 7 and Visual Studio whatever-the-current-version-is and play with it. Microsoft's products have a lot of flaws, but their development tools have always been top-notch, and I need to see what they've done recently. (In contrast, the Mac's development tools are basically 20 years old, but are still not quite &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile device development has always been a favorite pastime of mine. I've enjoyed learning my way around the iPhone API and tools, but I feel like I know it all. Diving into Android development should be fun, and will help me brush up on my Java skills. And unlike Apple, maybe Android needs me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I find myself drawn back to Windows on my desktop, and to an Android mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't hate Apple products, and I'm not bashing them. I just don't find them interesting anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching back to Windows on the desktop should be pretty easy, since I can just run it in VMWare on my Macbook for a while, and then Boot Camp it if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch from iPhone to Android would take a lot more commitment, so I'm going to go slow with that. I'll start by playing with the Android SDK, and I'll try to find a store with a Droid or other top-of-the-line Android device. I suspect I'll end up keeping my iPhone for real-world use, but I'll have an Android device for development purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll still definitely be getting an Apple tablet, though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>Google Wave</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/google-wave.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-18T14:17:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-18T14:17:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-18:/google-wave.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a former co-worker, I got an invite for &lt;a href="http://wave.google.com/"&gt;Google Wave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked fine in the iPhone Simulator, so I thought I was done. I loaded the app onto my iPod Touch, and it didn't work. Running in the debugger, I discovered that &lt;code&gt;logoImage&lt;/code&gt; was being set to &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would this not work on a device, when it ran fine in the simulator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the iPhone OS filesystem is case-sensitive, while the Mac OS X filesystem is not case-sensitive. The actual name of the image file was &lt;code&gt;icon.png&lt;/code&gt;, with a lowercase-&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, so it didn't match on iPhone OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No big deal, but it's another reminder that you always need to test on an actual device before considering an iPhone development task &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iphone"></category></entry><entry><title>Introducing Kids to Programming</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/introducing-kids-programming.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-11T00:28:52-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-11T00:28:52-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-11:/introducing-kids-programming.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;No time for a real blog entry today, but instead of nothing, here are some links to really cool toys that kids (and curious adults) can play with to learn about programming and multimedia:&lt;/p&gt;

But I really do create a new one of these practically every day to make my life a little easier, and maybe some of these will be useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one puts a UTC timestamp on the clipboard. The timestamp is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"&gt;ISO 8601&lt;/a&gt;-format string like "2009-11-09T13:14:03Z". If you'd like a different format, type "man date" in Terminal to see how to change the output format of the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; command in the shell script below.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start up Automator, and create a new Service which takes &lt;strong&gt;no input&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;any application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;Run Shell Script&lt;/strong&gt; action, with shell &lt;strong&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/strong&gt; and which passes input &lt;strong&gt;to stdin&lt;/strong&gt;. Replace the shell script text with this:&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;/bin/date -u '+%FT%TZ'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;Copy to Clipboard&lt;/strong&gt; action.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On days I do a lot of work on the app, I don't feel obligated to work too hard on the blog, but I will post a little something about whatever I worked on. Today, I got my iPhone app to connect to a &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html"&gt;Google App Engine&lt;/a&gt;-based web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without giving away too much, I'll just say that the iPhone app and the web site work together to provide a service to iPhone users.  I put the web site together in a couple of weekends. I decided to use Google Accounts for authentication, meaning that to log into my web site, either via a web browser or via the iPhone app, a user has to provide a Google account ID and password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do things this way, the server-side authentication stuff is easy. However, writing the client side is not easy, because the mechanism for authenticating with a Google account and connecting to a Google App Engine web site is not well documented. Luckily, I found a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/471898/google-app-engine-with-clientlogin-interface-for-objective-c"&gt;Stack Overflow question and answer&lt;/a&gt; that provided all the clues I needed to get my iPhone app working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using Google's API for implementing the web site, I'm growing increasingly frustrated with the Cocoa APIs. What takes two lines of code on the web side takes dozens of lines of code on the client side. Simple operations like connecting to a URL, downloading data, and storing it to a local database requires a lot of boilerplate code on the Cocoa side. It's not difficult, but it's incredibly verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that I'm using the Python API for Google App Engine. If I was using the Java API, then I'm sure it would be as grotesque as the Objective-C stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iphone"></category><category term="googleappengine"></category><category term="cocoa"></category></entry><entry><title>How Does One Become a Good Programmer?</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/how-does-one-become-good-programmer.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-07T18:03:52-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-07T18:03:52-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-07:/how-does-one-become-good-programmer.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a quote I like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

If I don't program for two or three days, I need to do it. And you get better at it …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a quote I like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really good programmers spend a lot of time programming. I haven't seen very good programmers who don't spend a lot of time programming. If I don't program for two or three days, I need to do it. And you get better at it&amp;mdash;you get quicker at it. The side effect of writing all this other stuff is that when you get to doing ordinary problems, you can do them very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's from Joe Armstrong, creator of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29"&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt;, in Peter Seibel's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/"&gt;Coders at Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (which, by the way, every programmer should read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This jibes with what I've seen over the years. Really good programmers don't treat coding as a nine-to-five job. It's something they want to do whether they are being paid for it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very easy way to weed out bad candidates when interviewing is to ask them about their personal programming projects. If they don't have any, then I'm pretty sure I don't want to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, programming is little different from other creative pursuits. You become a good writer by writing a lot; you become a good sculptor by sculpting a lot; you become a good musician by playing music a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go out there and write some code. That's what I'm about to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Automator Service: Scale Images by 75%</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/automator-service-scale-images-75.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-06T17:17:14-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-06T17:17:14-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-06:/automator-service-scale-images-75.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is yet another Snow Leopard Automator service: This one takes an image file and scales it down to 75% of its original size.

This is great for screenshots, as all the text is still readable at that size, but you can put it in a web page or document without filling the screen.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Use It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select one or more image files in the Finder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Services menu, choose &lt;strong&gt;Scale Images by 75%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for the scaled images on the desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to create the Automator screenshot you see at the bottom of this article, I used Shift-Command-4 to select an area of the screen. The screenshot image file was put on my desktop. Then I right-clicked the image file and chose &lt;strong&gt;Scale Images by 75%&lt;/strong&gt;, which created a new image file next to the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Create It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Automator, create a new Service that receives selected &lt;strong&gt;image files&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Finder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add these actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy Finder Items&lt;/strong&gt; (Note: you can skip this if you would rather replace the original image file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale Images&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;By Percentage&lt;/strong&gt; set to 75.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the service as "Scale Images by 75%".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every published writer has had it - the people who come up to you and tell you that they've Got An Idea. And boy, is it a Doozy. It's such a Doozy that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In his essay "&lt;a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F"&gt;Where Do You Get Your Ideas?&lt;/a&gt;," Neil&amp;nbsp;Gaiman relates a common situation faced by authors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every published writer has had it - the people who come up to you and tell you that they've Got An Idea. And boy, is it a Doozy. It's such a Doozy that they want to Cut You In On It. The proposal is always the same - they'll tell you the Idea (the hard bit), you write it down and turn it into a novel (the easy bit), the two of you can split the money fifty-fifty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer programmers often find themselves in similar situations. Some well-meaning person says they have a Great Idea for an application. They'll tell the programmer the idea, and then all the programmer has to do is write the code to implement it. The Idea Person will get the bulk of the credit, but the lucky programmer gets to ride those coattails. After all, coding must be easy: it's just a bunch of &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; somebody has to type. The idea, the design, the inspiration - that's the hard part, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: a great idea is a great idea, and a talented application designer is certainly worth more than the average programmer. But most people just aren't that smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if the idea is amazing and the designer creates a brilliant user experience, the bulk of the work still falls on the programmers' shoulders. If you take all the man-hours spent designing the iPhone, and all the man-hours spent implementing the operating system, frameworks, and standard applications, and making it all work the way the designers intended, I'd bet the latter number would be at least ten times the former. Maybe twenty times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming is just plain &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, in a way that related software-development activities are not. And it is &lt;em&gt;unforgiving&lt;/em&gt;. If a programmer makes a mistake, the program crashes or gives incorrect results. In contrast, if the UI designer makes a mistake, the consequences are not so dire; it just means the application is not quite as good as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's usually a programmer who has to fill in all the details of someone else's grand design. When it's 2:00 AM, and the architects are snuggled in their beds, and some program is crashing because nobody thought about how to handle a certain condition, it's a programmer who has to decide how to fix it. Programmers make dozens of these kinds of decisions every day, while the Big Picture guys talk about golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't intend to put programmers up on a pedestal. Developing good software also requires good designers, good artists, good technical writers, good testers, good managers, and a good user community. But, please, don't insult coders by treating them like a bunch of glorified typists. Programming requires as much imagination, inspiration, and perspiration as any other creative endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Easy Gradient Backgrounds for UITextViewCells</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/easy-gradient-backgrounds-uitextviewcells.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-03T00:28:23-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-03T00:28:23-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-03:/easy-gradient-backgrounds-uitextviewcells.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you create a table-view-based iPhone app, by default you get tables with plain white rows.

But all the cool kids are making apps with 3D-ish gradient backgrounds.  You want to make those kinds of apps too, right?  This article explains how.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making table cells with custom backgrounds is a common thing for iPhone developers to want to do, and there is a lot of information around the net about how to do it.  Why should you read this tutorial?  Well, this tutorial is designed to make it as easy as possible: just copy some files to your project, make a couple of source code changes, and &lt;em&gt;bang!&lt;/em&gt; instant gradient backgrounds.  With easy stuff like this out of the way, you can concentrate on doing whatever is unique for your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, unlike some older tutorials, this one lets you use the built-in &lt;code&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;textLabel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;detailTextLabel&lt;/code&gt; properties, rather than creating your own custom cell from scratch.  So it's easy to retrofit existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give credit where it's due, I got a lot of this information from the article &lt;a href="http://maniacdev.com/2009/10/how-to-make-ultra-slick-gradient-uitableview-cells/"&gt;How To Make Ultra-Slick Gradient UITableView Cells&lt;/a&gt; at manicadev.com, so go check that site out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we'll do is create a simple example project, and then show how to add the gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating the Example Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start by creating a run-of-the-mill iPhone app that displays a table.  These are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Xcode, choose the &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; New Project…&lt;/strong&gt; menu item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;iPhone OS -&amp;gt; Application&lt;/strong&gt; in the left pane of the &lt;strong&gt;New Project&lt;/strong&gt; dialog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Navigation-based Application&lt;/strong&gt;, leave &lt;strong&gt;Use Core Data for storage&lt;/strong&gt; uncheck, and click &lt;strong&gt;Choose…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the project as "GradientTableViewCellExample"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;RootViewController.m&lt;/code&gt; source file, and replace the &lt;code&gt;tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:&lt;/code&gt; methods with these bodies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;tableView:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nf"&gt;numberOfRowsInSection:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;tableView:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="nf"&gt;cellForRowAtIndexPath:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSIndexPath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;indexPath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CellIdentifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;Cell&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CellIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;initWithStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle&lt;/span&gt;
                                      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;reuseIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CellIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;autorelease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rowIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;indexPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;textLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;stringWithFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;Row %d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;rowIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;detailTextLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;stringWithFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;This is the detail text for row %d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;rowIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Build and run the project, and you'll see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/NoGradient.png" alt="App with no gradient"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad, but it would look more interesting if, instead of the flat white table cells, we had three-dimensional-looking gradient backgrounds on those cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding the Gradient Background Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we'll need a background image.  You can look at the &lt;a href="http://maniacdev.com/2009/10/how-to-make-ultra-slick-gradient-uitableview-cells/"&gt;How To Make Ultra-Slick Gradient UITableView Cells&lt;/a&gt; article to see how to make one of these from scratch, using Adobe Photoshop Elements, but here's an image you can steal directly from this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/CellGradientBackground.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/CellGradientBackground.png" alt="CellGradientBackground.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this image to your project, or create your own background image if you're so-inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding the GradientTableViewCell class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the source files &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/GradientTableViewCell.h"&gt;GradientTableViewCell.h&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/GradientTableViewCell.m"&gt;GradientTableViewCell.m&lt;/a&gt;, and add them to your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GradientTableViewCell&lt;/code&gt; overrides two methods of &lt;code&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/code&gt;.  First, we override the &lt;code&gt;initWithStyle:reuseIdentifier:&lt;/code&gt; method so that it adds the gradient background image, stretching it to fill the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;initWithStyle:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UITableViewCellStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;reuseIdentifier:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reuseIdentifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;initWithStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;reuseIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reuseIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;imageNamed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;CellGradientBackground.png&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIImageView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imageView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIImageView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;initWithImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;imageView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;contentMode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIViewContentModeScaleToFill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backgroundView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;imageView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imageView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, we have to override the &lt;code&gt;setSelected:animated:&lt;/code&gt; method.  The inherited method sets the cell's subviews' background colors, but we want the subviews to have transparent backgrounds so that the gradient background shows through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setSelected:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;selected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;animated:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setSelected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;selected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;contentView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subviews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clearColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Using the GradientTableViewCell class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we just have to change our &lt;code&gt;RootViewController.m&lt;/code&gt; file so that it will use &lt;code&gt;GradientTableViewCell&lt;/code&gt; instead of a plain old &lt;code&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add an &lt;code&gt;#import&lt;/code&gt; at the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#import &amp;quot;GradientTableViewCell.h&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, change this line in &lt;code&gt;tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;initWithStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="nl"&gt;reuseIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CellIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GradientTableViewCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;initWithStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;reuseIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CellIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Build and run the project, and you should get this:&lt;/p&gt;

I've decided against that, because I don't want to feel pressure to add filler, but before deciding that, I created an Automator service that would help me to count words.
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Use the Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it, just select some text, hit Command-C to copy it to the clipboard, and then choose &lt;strong&gt;Speak Count of Words on Clipboard&lt;/strong&gt; from the application's &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Create It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how to create the service (using Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, of course):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Automator, and choose "Service" as the workflow template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose "no input" and "any application" in the "Service receives . . ." section at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag a &lt;strong&gt;Get Contents of Clipboard&lt;/strong&gt; action from the left column to the workflow pane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag a &lt;strong&gt;Run Shell Script&lt;/strong&gt; action from the left column to the workflow pane, beneath the &lt;strong&gt;Get Contents of Clipboard&lt;/strong&gt; action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Run Shell Script&lt;/strong&gt; text area, replace "cat" with this:&lt;pre&gt;
echo "The selection contains &amp;#96;wc -w&amp;#96; words."&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag a &lt;strong&gt;Speak Text&lt;/strong&gt; action from the left column into the workflow area, beneath the &lt;strong&gt;Run Shell Script&lt;/strong&gt; action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; Save&lt;/strong&gt; menu item, and save it as "Speak Count of Words on Clipboard".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how it should look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/Speak_Count_of_Words_on_Clipboard_service.png" alt="Picture"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you are going to use this a lot, go to the Services Preferences and assign a keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="snowleopard"></category><category term="osx"></category><category term="mac"></category><category term="automator"></category></entry><entry><title>Not Quite NaNoWriMo</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/not-quite-nanowrimo.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-01T23:28:33-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-01T23:28:33-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-11-01:/not-quite-nanowrimo.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/iStock_000002585519XSmall.jpg" alt="Picture"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead of doing that, I'm going to commit to do these things during November:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish a blog article every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a new iPhone application into the App Store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article does not count as a daily blog entry, as it is really more of a meta-entry. The real blog entries need to be programming-related or computer-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you'll be seeing a lot of blog entries from me this month.

&lt;li&gt;Read Matt Gemmell's "&lt;a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2009/07/14/iphone-development-emergency-guide"&gt;iPhone Development Emergency Guide&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you'll be able to delve into the other things you need in Apple's documentation.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, write lots of little iPhone apps before you start on that big important app you really want to write.

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm learning all …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife recently gave me a nice gift: a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader"&gt;Sony Reader&lt;/a&gt; device. She'd been watching me read books using the Kindle for iPhone app, and felt sorry for me because I had to read from such a small screen. The Reader is really nice. (Thanks, honey.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm learning all about how to get content onto the device. The Sony&amp;nbsp;eBookLibrary software that you use to copy files to the device is pretty bad (worse than iTunes, if you can believe that), so I'm using it as little as possible. I ran across &lt;a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/"&gt;calibre&lt;/a&gt;, a nice open-source tool for managing various e-reader devices. Unfortunately, it can't handle the DRM'ed files that one downloads from the Sony&amp;nbsp;eBookstore, and after transferring books to the device, the device often crashes and has to reboot itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my compromise for now is to use calibre's &lt;code&gt;ebook-convert&lt;/code&gt; command-line utility to convert files to EPUB format, and then use Sony eBookLibrary to transfer those to the device. To make this easier, I've created a service, using Automator, that will invoke &lt;code&gt;ebook-convert&lt;/code&gt; on files selected in the Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want such a thing for yourself, here's how to make it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the calibre command-line tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/download"&gt;calibre&lt;/a&gt; and install it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start calibre, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; toolbar button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Advanced in the list on the left, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Install command-line tools&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: This requires Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or newer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the Automator application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prompted to choose a workflow template, select &lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; and click &lt;strong&gt;Choose&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Service receives selected&lt;/strong&gt; list, choose &lt;strong&gt;documents&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; list, choose &lt;strong&gt;Finder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag a &lt;strong&gt;Run shell script&lt;/strong&gt; action from the list into the workflow area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the &lt;strong&gt;Shell:&lt;/strong&gt; option set to &lt;strong&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;Pass input:&lt;/strong&gt; option, choose &lt;strong&gt;as arguments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the script text to this:
&lt;pre&gt;
    for f in "$@"
    do
        /usr/bin/ebook-convert "$f" "$f.epub" --output-profile=sony
    done
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; Save&lt;/strong&gt; menu item, and give the service a name like "Convert to EPUB"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test your new service, go to the Finder and select a text, RTF, PDF, or other such file, and then choose the &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; Services -&amp;gt; Convert to EPUB&lt;/strong&gt; menu item. Note that conversion may take a while, depending upon how large the input file is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a newbie at this.

This usually results in an Emacs that works the way I expect, rather than the way some "helpful" distributor thinks it ought to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll assume you have the developer tools and &lt;code&gt;bzr&lt;/code&gt; installed, and know how to open Terminal and type some commands. Here are the commands you need to type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bzr init-repo --2a emacs/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd emacs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bzr branch bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/trunk/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd trunk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;./configure --with-ns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make install&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this is complete, you'll end up with &lt;code&gt;Emacs.app&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;nextstep&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory. You can run &lt;code&gt;Emacs.app&lt;/code&gt; from there, or copy it to your Applications directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2010/10/29:&lt;/strong&gt; Discovered that the Emacs team now uses Bazaar (&lt;code&gt;bzr&lt;/code&gt;) rather than CVS. Updated the instructions accordingly, following advice from http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS and http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BzrForEmacsDevs. Also, found what appears to be a faithful binary distribution at http://emacsformacosx.com/.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="osx"></category><category term="mac"></category><category term="emacs"></category></entry><entry><title>The iTunes UI Sucks</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/itunes-ui-sucks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-08T11:13:41-04:00</published><updated>2009-09-08T11:13:41-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-09-08:/itunes-ui-sucks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like most of Apple's products, but iTunes is a very dark corner of the Mac universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three steps, requiring moving the mouse pointer all the way across the screen between each. There is no automatic-update feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is probably some way to write an AppleScript to automate this, but &lt;a href="http://www.grumpytico.com/?p=66"&gt;AppleScript sucks too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase &lt;a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html"&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup&lt;/a&gt;: There is software everyone complains about, and software nobody uses. One could chalk up the iTunes hate to the simple fact that so many people are forced to use it whether they like it or not. But iTunes really does suck.

These are my thoughts about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MINI Cooper convertible is the Apple Macintosh of cars.  It's very expensive in comparison to other models with similar performance and features, and it has a lot of annoying flaws, but people who own them absolutely love them. It is the only car I've owned that has &lt;em&gt;delighted&lt;/em&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I'll note that I am not a "car guy." I won't say anything about horsepower, torque, zero-to-60, how it handles on a race course, or how it compares to any of the bazillion other cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start with what I don't like. It's small. Two adults fit in the front seats fine, but the rear seat is basically unusable. The trunk is almost unusable as well. We've had to cut shopping trips short because we knew we were carrying more shopping bags in our hands than would fit in the car. A full-size suitcase won't fit in the trunk, so think "duffel bags" if you want to do any traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's small, you don't get a lot of the advantages of a small car. We only get about 26 MPG, in mostly highway driving. It's short nose-to-tail, but is about as wide as a typical car, so you can't squeeze into those parking spaces that other cars have to pass by. The turning radius is a lot wider than you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the convertible top up, visibility is terrible. You can't see much out the rear window, due to the roll-bar thingees on top of the rear seats, and the blind spots in the rear quarters are huge. I often have to put my chin down on the steering wheel to see traffic signals, due to the low ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPS system sucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with all those problems, I'm still thrilled with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its small size and tiny engine, it feels more like a mid-size car. It's very stable, and takes corners well. The automatic transmission works pretty well in most circumstances, and switching into the semi-automatic mode is great when driving on twisty mountain roads like the one that goes up to my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has this magical aura that makes people smile. People come up to me in parking lots and ask about it. Other MINI drivers wave at me on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you just want practical inexpensive transportation, stay away from the MINI. But if you want to be happy when you're driving, give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Don't buy a MINI or any other car from Global Imports BMW in Atlanta. &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2008/12/letter-to-global-imports-bmw.html"&gt;Those guys suck.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>Changing Background Color and Section Header Text Color in a Grouped-style UITableView</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/changing-background-color-and-section-header-text-color-grouped-style-uitableview.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-08-26T00:10:40-04:00</published><updated>2009-08-26T00:10:40-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-08-26:/changing-background-color-and-section-header-text-color-grouped-style-uitableview.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While working on an iPhone application, I decided I wanted to change the colors of the background and section headers of a &lt;code&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;UITableViewStyleGrouped&lt;/code&gt; style.

It took a lot more work than I expected, so I'm sharing what I learned with anyone else who needs to do this.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
To review: when you create a table view with the grouped style, each section of the table shows up as a rounded rectangle, section titles are displayed as dark gray text between the rectangles, and the background is gray. I wanted the background to be a pale pastel color, so I looked into how to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I first looked at the options in Interface Builder.  A table view has a background color that can be set in IB, but setting that didn't accomplish anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bit of Googling, I learned that the way to give a table view a background color is to set the background color to &lt;code&gt;[UIColor clearColor]&lt;/code&gt;, and let the color (or image) of whatever is behind the table view show through. So, I set my window's &lt;code&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/code&gt; to the color I wanted, and then added this to my table view's controller class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define TableViewTag 8888&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Make table view&amp;#39;s background transparent to allow window background to be visible&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;viewWithTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TableViewTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clearColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Interface Builder, I set the tag of the table view to 8888. Another way to do this would be to have an outlet for the table view, but I didn't want to do that in this particular case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that gave the table the background color I wanted, but I then noticed that the dark-gray section titles didn't look good against that color. I started looking for some sort of "&lt;code&gt;sectionHeaderTextColor&lt;/code&gt;" property on the table view, but of course, there was no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more Googling, I concluded that there was no way to just set the color. What you have to do is provide your own custom section header view containing a text label. With that, you can set whatever colors you want. So, I added these implementations of &lt;code&gt;UITableViewDataSource&lt;/code&gt; protocol methods to my table view controller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define SectionHeaderHeight 40&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CGFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;tableView:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;heightForHeaderInSection:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;titleForHeaderInSection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SectionHeaderHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// If no section header title, no section header needed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UIView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;tableView:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;viewForHeaderInSection:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;addSubview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also added a suitable implementation of &lt;code&gt;tableView:titleForHeaderInSection:&lt;/code&gt;, and everything worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a simpler way to do this, I'd love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="samplecode"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="iphone"></category><category term="code"></category><category term="cocoa"></category><category term="iosdev"></category></entry><entry><title>Netgear ReadyNAS Duo 2000 Setup and Review</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/netgear-readynas-duo-2000-setup-and-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-08-20T00:40:10-04:00</published><updated>2009-08-20T00:40:10-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-08-20:/netgear-readynas-duo-2000-setup-and-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have previously written about my &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/2007/10/26/backups"&gt;backup strategy&lt;/a&gt;.

I've never really worried about backups too much. In the 30 years I've been using computers, I've never lost a hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...until last weekend. My wife's MacBook Air was displaying some funny behavior, so I ran Disk Utility on it. Disk Utility said the drive had problems, so I clicked &lt;em&gt;Repair Disk&lt;/em&gt;, and it would not boot thereafter. I called Apple, and their expert told me I'd have to erase the drive and reinstall the operating system. We had no backups for that machine. My wife was not happy to lose everything. And of course, it is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; fault she had no backups. (I've told her about Time Machine, but she didn't believe it could really be that easy to set up, so she never did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, better late than never, I decided to get some network storage and start backing up everything to it. A friend was happy with his Netgear ReadyNAS, so I ordered a Netgear ReadyNAS Duo 2000 from Amazon, along with two 1-TB Western Digital Caviar Green hard drives. Total price came out to about $400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ReadyNAS has two drive bays. Most models come with a drive included, but I bought the "bare" one that has no preinstalled drives, assuming that it would be cheaper to buy my own drives. Upon reading the manuals, I immediately hit a problem: the manuals explain how to add a second hard drive to a ReadyNAS that comes with a single drive, but nothing about what to do if you have an empty ReadyNAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping for the best, I installed the two Caviar drives in the NAS, plugged it into the network, plugged it into power, and hit the power button. It turned on, but the slowly blinking LED didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed the RAIDar software, which one uses to manage the device, and it told me I had bad disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about half an hour of Googling, registering the product, registering for the Netgear forums, and registering for the ReadyNAS forums (each of which required separate sign-up forms and e-mail confirmations), I finally found a current &lt;a href="http://www.readynas.com/forum/faq.php"&gt;ReadyNAS FAQ&lt;/a&gt; (after hitting a few old FAQs that were created before my model existed). There was nothing specific about my situation, but I decided I would try the "factory reset". That worked: RAIDar enabled its Setup button, and I was able to initialize everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially worried about the fan noise. When the ReadyNAS boots up, the fans are incredibly loud for something that small. After 30 seconds or so, the noise drops a little, but it was still really loud. A Google search for "readynas loud fan" indicated that lots of users have replaced their ReadyNAS fans, due to the noise. But after the drives got formatted, the fan noise dropped to a barely detectable level. It's not as quiet as my Macs, but it's not loud enough to be annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very easy to set up &lt;a href="http://www.readynas.com/?p=1097"&gt;Time Machine with the ReadyNAS&lt;/a&gt;. (First thing I did was back up my wife's Air, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ReadyNAS has a lot of other features that I am not yet using. $400 for a backup solution seems a little pricey, when one can buy a 1-TB drive and enclosure for about $100, but having storage available on the network means we're more likely to actually do backups. We'll see how things go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Motion detectors that will deliver an electric shock to anyone who tries to hurt any of the security dudes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A special button, carried in his back pocket, that will instantly drop an anvil on any attackers. The anvil won't hurt them too much; it will just knock them through the floor into a jail cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A locked room containing gold bricks. The only people with keys to this room will be Bailey, his best friend, and the security dudes. The security dudes get paid twenty dollars per week, and two gold bricks per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was about ten years old, my father took me to an IBM open house. Dad worked for IBM during its heyday, when it was the biggest computer company in the world and would seemingly control the computer industry forever. Employees were treated very well, with lots of company-sponsored picnics, dinners, holiday parties, and so forth. This open house was a celebration of the opening of yet another new IBM office in the Atlanta area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a smart kid, but had never played with computers. This was before TRS-80's and other home computers were available. I think we may have had some Sears-marketed Pong game at home, but otherwise my experience with computers consisted of what I saw in sci-fi TV shows and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While walking around the office, Dad showed me and the rest of my family the IBM systems. I was bored: all I saw were a bunch of glass-walled rooms containing green-screen terminals with huge printers connected to them, and guides bragged about how many pages of text could fit in their memories and how fast the tractor-feed printers could print reports and paychecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, almost as an afterthought, we went into this little room where a couple of bearded guys were sitting at a small terminal. I immediately sensed that these guys were not like the other IBM'ers. I now know these guys were &lt;em&gt;programmers&lt;/em&gt;, but back then I just knew that even though these guys wore ties, they weren't businessmen.  These guys were different, and cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked me if I wanted to play a game on their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was Lunar Lander.  It was a purely text-based game, without any graphics or joystick controllers or other videogamey stuff.  It told me how high above the lunar surface I was, and what my rate of descent was, and asked me how much fuel I wanted to burn.  (See &lt;a href="http://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/"&gt;40 Years of Lunar Lander&lt;/a&gt; for examples of what this experience was like.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to successfully land, even after several tries, but I was suddenly and permanently obsessed with computers.  I had no idea how they worked, but I knew that the computer contained an imaginary universe where a lunar lander was descending toward the moon. I figured that if I learned how computers worked, I could create some imaginary universes of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I started asking Dad about how computers worked, and he started borrowing manuals from the system engineers and bringing them home to me.  Then I got an Atari 800 computer for Christmas one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, there have not been very many days that I have not been playing around with imaginary universes.  I owe it all to Lunar Lander and supportive parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Mom and Dad, and also thank you to the nameless, bearded guys who invited me to join their game.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="selfindulgence"></category></entry><entry><title>iPhone Camp Atlanta 2009</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/iphone-camp-atlanta-2009.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-19T14:22:16-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-19T14:22:16-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-07-19:/iphone-camp-atlanta-2009.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I attended &lt;a href="http://iphonecampatlanta.org/"&gt;iPhone Camp Atlanta 2009&lt;/a&gt;, a conference for iPhone developers and others interested in iPhone development (business/marketing people).

At the same time and in the same venue, &lt;a href="http://www.mobilecampatlanta.org/"&gt;Mobile Camp Atlanta 2009&lt;/a&gt; was taking place, targeting developers for Blackberry, Android, Palm Pre, and Windows Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was organized as a "BarCamp-style event." I had no idea what that meant. It means that on the day of the conference, attendees who want to give presentations sign up and give them. There were five presentation rooms, and nine half-hour time slots, which meant that 45 sessions could have taken place. The actual number of sessions was about half that, because there just weren't that many people who came prepared to give presentations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each session was scheduled to be 30 minutes long. In reality, each session was only about 20 minutes, due to in-between-session movement and other logistics. I would have liked to have seen some longer sessions with more detail, but the short-session format did keep things from dragging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the sessions I attended. I sat in on a few iPhone development sessions, related to use of Google Toolkit for iPhone, XML parsing, and Core Data. I also sat in on a couple of business-oriented sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most conferences, the real reason to attend is not to learn material in the sessions, but to network with other people.  Unfortunately, I'm not a great networker, so I wasn't able to take advantage of that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers did a great job. I'll go again next year. Maybe I'll even work up the courage to give a presentation myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iphone"></category><category term="conference"></category></entry><entry><title>Adding a Custom View to an NSStatusItem</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/adding-custom-view-nsstatusitem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-07T11:48:30-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-07T11:48:30-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-07-07:/adding-custom-view-nsstatusitem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://capablehands.net/menubarcountdown"&gt;Menubar Countdown&lt;/a&gt; application uses an &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSStatusItem_Class/Reference/Reference.html"&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/a&gt; to display itself in the menu bar.

I recently had to add a custom view to that status item, and thought I'd share what I learned about the process here.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
A little background: a &lt;em&gt;status item&lt;/em&gt; is one of those little thingees you see on the right side of the Mac OS&amp;nbsp;X menu bar, such as the clock, the Spotlight icon, the sound volume control, and so forth.  Programmatically, you create a status item by doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSStatusBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSStatusBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;systemStatusBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;statusItemWithLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSVariableStatusItemLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you've created a status item, you can do these things with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call the &lt;code&gt;setTitle:&lt;/code&gt; method to display a string in the menu bar (or call &lt;code&gt;setAttributedTitle&lt;/code&gt; to display an attributed string)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call the &lt;code&gt;setMenu:&lt;/code&gt; method so that a menu is displayed when the status item is clicked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call the &lt;code&gt;setHighlightMode:&lt;/code&gt; method with &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt; to cause the title to be highlighted appropriately when a menu is displayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call the &lt;code&gt;setTooltip:&lt;/code&gt; method to set a tooltip to be displayed when the mouse hovers over the status item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other things you can do with a status item, but the above describes the features that Menubar&amp;nbsp;Countdown uses.  When the timer is running, the application simply calls &lt;code&gt;setTitle:&lt;/code&gt; once per second to display 00:25:00, 00:24:59, 00:24:58, and so on down to 00:00:00.  The user can click the item to display a menu that controls the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code&gt;setTitle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setImage&lt;/code&gt; methods give many developers all the display functionality they need, NSStatusItem also offers the ability to set a custom view that displays in the menu bar.  I decided I wanted to add some animation, so I needed a view.  The problem is that if you set a custom view, you are responsible for all the drawing and event handling; NSStatusItem no longer does any of that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours of Googling and experimentation, I wound up with something that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I wanted a view class with two properties: &lt;code&gt;statusItem&lt;/code&gt;, which would be a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/code&gt; associated with the view, and &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, which would be the string displayed in the menu bar.  The &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute would make it easy to update the app, as I could just change every instance of &lt;code&gt;[statusItem setTitle:...]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;[statusItemView setTitle:...]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my class declaration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StatusItemView&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NSView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(The purpose of the &lt;code&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/code&gt; instance variable will be explained later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initialization and deallocation methods are straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;initWithFrame:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;initWithFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;dealloc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dealloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;statusItem&lt;/code&gt; property can be simply synthesized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;@synthesize statusItem;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, we'll tackle menu handling.  When our view is clicked, we want to display the menu, and while the menu is displayed, we want our item to be displayed in a highlighted state.  &lt;code&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/code&gt; provides the method &lt;code&gt;popUpStatusItemMenu:&lt;/code&gt; to display the menu in the right place under the menu bar.  To deal with highlighting, we have an instance variable &lt;code&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/code&gt; that will be set to &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt; whenever the menu is being displayed, and &lt;code&gt;NO&lt;/code&gt; when it is not.  We can use the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/nsmenu_Class/Reference/Reference.html"&gt;NSMenu&lt;/a&gt; delegate &lt;code&gt;menuWillOpen:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;menuDidClose&lt;/code&gt; methods to be notified when the menu is shown or closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mouseDown:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSEvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;popUpStatusItemMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setNeedsDisplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;rightMouseDown:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSEvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Treat right-click just like left-click&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;mouseDown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;menuWillOpen:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSMenu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setNeedsDisplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;menuDidClose:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSMenu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setNeedsDisplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; property affects the display, so we can't just synthesize it.  When the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; is set, we need to determine the bounding rectangle of the text, and then set the status item's &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; so that it can contain the text.  Setting the status item's length also updates the custom view's bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some experimentation and zooming, I figured out that when a normal &lt;code&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/code&gt; draws its title, there is a horizontal margin of six pixels between the side of the item's display and the text, and a margin of three pixels between the bottom of the display and the text.  We need those values to calculate status item size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;#define StatusItemViewPaddingWidth  6
#define StatusItemViewPaddingHeight 3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To determine the text's bounding rectangle, we can call &lt;code&gt;NSString&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;boundingRectWithSize:options:attributes:&lt;/code&gt; method, but to do that, we need to construct an &lt;em&gt;attributes&lt;/em&gt; dictionary that describes the font and other aspects of drawing.  We'll use the same attributes dictionary in our &lt;code&gt;drawRect:&lt;/code&gt; method, so when we construct it we'll include the desired foreground drawing color in the attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;titleForegroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;whiteColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blackColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;titleAttributes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use default menu bar font size&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSFont&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSFont&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;menuBarFontOfSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foregroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titleForegroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSFontAttributeName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;foregroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSForegroundColorAttributeName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;titleBoundingRect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;boundingRectWithSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSMakeSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1e100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1e100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                               &lt;span class="nl"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="nl"&gt;attributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titleAttributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;titleBoundingRect&lt;/code&gt; method defined, we can implement the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setTitle:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;newTitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;isEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;newTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;newTitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;newTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Update status item size (which will also update this view&amp;#39;s bounds)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSRect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titleBounds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titleBoundingRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;newWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titleBounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StatusItemViewPaddingWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;newWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setNeedsDisplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can implement &lt;code&gt;drawRect:&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;NSStatusItem&lt;/code&gt; provides a method &lt;code&gt;drawStatusBarBackgroundInRect:withHighlight:&lt;/code&gt; that will draw the appropriate background for a status item, so we just call that and then draw the title at the correct position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;drawRect:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Draw status bar background, highlighted if menu is showing&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;drawStatusBarBackgroundInRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="nl"&gt;withHighlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isMenuVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Draw title string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSPoint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSMakePoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StatusItemViewPaddingWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;StatusItemViewPaddingHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;drawAtPoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;withAttributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titleAttributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's it for the view class.  Here is the code in my application controller that sets it all up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSStatusBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;systemStatusBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;statusItemWithLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSVariableStatusItemLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItemView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StatusItemView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItemView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItemView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItemView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItemView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setToolTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSLocalizedString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;Menubar Countdown&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                             &lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;Status Item Tooltip&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItemView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statusItemView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;setTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;@&amp;quot;00:00:00&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(There is a minor gotcha here: You have to call the status item's &lt;code&gt;setView:&lt;/code&gt; before calling the view's &lt;code&gt;setTitle:&lt;/code&gt;, because the view needs to call the status item's &lt;code&gt;setLength:&lt;/code&gt; method.  I could have fixed that, but decided it wasn't worth the effort.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we are creating the view programmatically. I tried creating it in Interface Builder and setting all the connections that way, but the result was a view with funky &lt;code&gt;bounds&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt; properties that didn't display itself the right way.  Google found some other people with the same problem, and while some had found solutions, I didn't understand them. (Maybe someone can explain it to me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, after a couple of hours of work, I had a custom status item view that makes the status item look just like it did before I had the custom view.  Progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn't leave the view that way.  I called &lt;code&gt;setWantsLayer:&lt;/code&gt; on the view and started doing Core&amp;nbsp;Animation stuff.  Maybe I'll write about that next time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category><category term="menubarcountdown"></category><category term="code"></category><category term="cocoa"></category><category term="macdev"></category></entry><entry><title>Anti-pattern: The Overly Generic Interface</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/anti-pattern-overly-generic-interface.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-04T14:43:25-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-04T14:43:25-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-07-04:/anti-pattern-overly-generic-interface.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While learning about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Animation"&gt;Core Animation&lt;/a&gt;, I was disappointed to find that it is plagued by the anti-pattern that I call the &lt;em&gt;Overly Generic Interface&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;!--break--&gt;
The Overly Generic Interface is an interface that provides a very small set of functions, but each function takes parameters that allow one to do a lot of different things.  For example, in C++ an overly generic interface would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A Value object can hold a string, an integer, a float, an object pointer, etc.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Return the value of a named property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;propertyName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Set the value of a named property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;propertyName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Set the values of multiple named properties with one call&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Invoke a named operation with a parameter list&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;performOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;operationName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                          &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And application code that uses the interface looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Gender&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Female&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Male&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Initialize husband, using the set-one-property-at-a-time interface&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;husband&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;husband&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;firstName&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Kristopher&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;husband&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;lastName&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Johnson&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;husband&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;gender&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Male&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wifeProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;firstName&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Pebble&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wifeProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;lastName&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Johnson&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wifeProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Gender&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Female&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wifeProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Invoke the recordMarriage operation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push_back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromPointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;husband&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push_back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValueFromPointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;recorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;performOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;recordMarriage&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The supposed benefits (as far as I can tell) of a very generic interface are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes to the interface are not needed as new properties and operations are added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the set of properties and operations is huge, you don't need a huge class declaration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The set of available properties and operations can be different for different instances of a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Property names and operation names can be "magic" things with powerful behavior.  (For example, maybe the above interface could let you specify something like &lt;code&gt;wifesName = husband.getProperty("findWife#name")&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes it easy to create tools that bind things to other things, via names and string values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be performance benefits for the “set multiple properties in a single call” operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be performance benefits if it maps directly to a lower-level interface (a device driver, for example).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I hate such interfaces, for these reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code is ugly and hard to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The compiler can't check whether you’ve correctly spelled all the property names or whether you have passed the right type of data for each one.  (For example, did you notice that I capitalized the name of the &lt;code&gt;gender&lt;/code&gt; property inconsistently in the above example?  If not, how would you have found that bug?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The debugger can't easily show you the values of properties in an object, because they are not exposed as simple instance variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhere external to code, you need to maintain documentation about what all the valid names and values are.  And you need to constantly refer to that external documentation, because your IDE won't be able to help you with auto-completion and other time-saving features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic is not always helpful. The magic names often have a syntax that is different from that of the “host language,” so programmers essentially have another language to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration of the first objection, I think the following would be a lot more readable and easier to maintain than the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Person husband;
husband.setFirstName(&amp;quot;Kristopher&amp;quot;);
husband.setLastName(&amp;quot;Johnson&amp;quot;);
husband.setGender(Male);

Person wife;
wife.setFirstName(&amp;quot;Pebble&amp;quot;);
wife.setLastName(&amp;quot;Johnson&amp;quot;);
wife.setGender(Female);

recorder.recordMarriage(husband, wife);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; class here could be derived from &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getFirstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setFirstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getLastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setLastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// and so on, for all properties&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and in this case you would have both the generic &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; interface and the specific &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; interfaces available.  I have no objection to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generic interface is often useful (e.g., &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CocoaBindingsRef/CocoaBindingsRef.html"&gt;Cocoa Bindings&lt;/a&gt;). My objection is to those API’s that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; provide the generic interface. In Core&amp;nbsp;Animation, practically everything is done by creating &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt; objects, populating them with obscure keys and objects, and then passing them to the API. There are a few higher-level interfaces available, but they don't provide access to all of Core&amp;nbsp;Animation's functionality, so using the low-level overly generic interface is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names are important, and therefore names should be explicitly declared.  Otherwise, they are hidden from the compiler, from the IDE, from the debugger, and from programmers who read class declarations.  Hidden names and magic names cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with an Overly Generic Interface, I almost always end up writing some sort of wrapper around it.  It would be nice if I didn't have to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Review: Core Animation for Mac OS X and the iPhone, by Bill Dudney</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/review-core-animation-mac-os%C2%A0x-and-iphone-bill%C2%A0dudney.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-04T11:54:17-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-04T11:54:17-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-07-04:/review-core-animation-mac-os x-and-iphone-bill dudney.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Either I’m stupid, or Apple’s developer documentation sucks.

Whenever I try to enter a new area of Cocoa development, I am presented with simplistic tutorials and detailed reference information, with little in between to bridge the gap between newbie and expert. Often, the only way to learn an API is to hack on the example programs until enlightenment occurs, or do a lot of Googling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what happened with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Animation"&gt;Core Animation&lt;/a&gt;. Most OS&amp;nbsp;X developers don't need to know much about Core&amp;nbsp;Animation, as it is a relatively new feature of OS&amp;nbsp;X, and Mac users don't expect fancy animations in every application's UI. However, on iPhone, users do expect things to bounce and zip around the screen, so an iPhone developer really needs to know this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading Apple’s &lt;em&gt;Core&amp;nbsp;Animation Programming Guide&lt;/em&gt; several times, and each time, I got lost in Chapter 2. Skipping forward to subsequent chapters didn't get me anywhere.  I was presented with architectural diagrams and abstract discussions of geometry and transforms and layers and timing and so forth, but there was nothing concrete that I could grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Dudney’s &lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/bdcora/core-animation-for-mac-os-x-and-the-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core Animation for Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X and the iPhone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; filled in the gaps perfectly.  It doesn't contain much information that is not in Apple's docs, but it presents it in a way that makes sense to me.  Dudney leads you by the hand through actual working code that does cool stuff.  After reading this book, I now understand what Apple was trying to tell me in the &lt;em&gt;Core&amp;nbsp;Animation Programming&amp;nbsp;Guide&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the PDF-formatted version. I also tried reading the epub-formatted version using Stanza on the iPhone, but that didn't work so well: the diagrams and code examples aren't readable.  So I recommend sticking to the PDF or paper formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only gripe is that I'd like to see more iPhone-specific information. The majority of the book covers Core&amp;nbsp;Animation on OS&amp;nbsp;X, and then there is a single chapter at the end about the iPhone. I would prefer to have an iPhone-centric book with an oh-by-the-way-this-works-on-OS-X-too chapter. But that's a minor quibble; I think I understand the material well enough now that I can learn the iPhone-specific aspects of Core&amp;nbsp;Animation on my own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="review"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="book"></category><category term="coreanimation"></category><category term="iphone"></category></entry><entry><title>iPhone Temperature Warning</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/iphone-temperature-warning.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-29T16:59:24-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-29T16:59:24-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-06-29:/iphone-temperature-warning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you're curious: here's what you'll see if you rescue your iPhone from a hot car:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a stylistic rule somewhere that said a function should have no more than five parameters, the programmer &amp;ldquo;refactored&amp;rdquo; it to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SetObjectParams1(obj, foo, bar, baz, quux);
SetObjectParams2(obj, xyzzy, abra, cadabra, hocus);
SetObjectParams3(obj, pocus, presto, shazam);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No, that's not how one resolves this problem. You fix this problem by defining functions that each do something simple, give each function a name that describes what it does, and let them take however many parameters make sense.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Menubar Countdown 1.2 Released</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/menubar-countdown-12-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-23T01:32:26-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-23T01:32:26-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-06-23:/menubar-countdown-12-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://capablehands.net/menubarcountdown"&gt;Menubar Countdown&lt;/a&gt; is a simple countdown timer that displays itself on the right side of the Mac OS X menu bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fugly, eh?  Not only is it ugly, but the narrow shape makes it hard to recognize as an icon, and makes it hard to click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For version 1.2, I wanted a better icon. I thought an hourglass would be a good symbol, so after a few hours of looking at images on the web and dinking around in Photoshop Elements, I wound up with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/HourglassIcon256x256.png" alt="Proposed Menubar Countdown Icon" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm was very happy with it.  Unfortunately, the hourglass image is based upon a photo I licensed from iStockphoto. iStockphoto considers an application icon to be the same as a logo or trademark, and such usage is expressly prohibited by their licenses. I'm not a lawyer, but I assume this is to prevent someone from putting a stock image into a logo and then suing all the other users of that image for trademark infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I again went to the web, to look for public-domain images I could use. I eventually wound up with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/NewHourglassIcon256x256.png" alt="New Menubar Countdown Icon" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like it as much as the last one, but I've decided I've spent too much time on my application icon, and not enough time on making the application better, so this will be the icon for version 1.2. Maybe I'll revisit it for the next version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the good old days when a Macintosh application icon was a 32x32 black-and-white bitmap. Those were pretty easy for a non-artist like me to create, using simple tools like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resedit"&gt;ResEdit&lt;/a&gt;. Now, this stuff is better left in the hands of professional designers, but Menubar Countdown is free, so I trust users will be satisfied with my amateurish effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are any real designers out there who would like to give me a better icon, I'd definitely appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="menubarcountdown"></category></entry><entry><title>ESATInformer = FAIL</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/esatinformer-fail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-11T16:11:54-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-11T16:11:54-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-06-11:/esatinformer-fail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my clients, whose e-mail system I have to use, uses a product called ESATInformer to filter spam.

They want to know what programming language they should learn, which programming tools to use, and so on. These are hard questions to answer. It's like asking "I'd like to be a musician. Which instruments and which pieces of music should I learn?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about an application you'd like to see developed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn what you need to know to develop that app, and develop it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming&lt;/em&gt; is a big field. Choosing a concrete goal narrows it to something manageable. Once you know exactly what you want to make, it is a lot easier to decide upon a programming language and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional programmers don't "learn how to program" and then just apply that knowledge for the rest of their careers. Every day, we learn new things: programming languages, tools, libraries, operating systems, and so on. We pick it up as we go, learning what we need to know as it's needed. If you want to be a programmer, you need to learn how to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>OmniFocus Review</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/omnifocus-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-30T14:21:46-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-30T14:21:46-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-05-30:/omnifocus-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've written before about my &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2008/12/ultimate-to-do-list-application-for.html"&gt;Ultimate To-Do List Application for iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.

I was pretty happy with what I wound up with, but it still wasn't helping me much. Writing down your desired actions is only one part of &lt;a href="http://www.davidco.com"&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; (GTD); you also need to organize and process things, and a simple list of lists wasn't helping me do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I've decided to give &lt;a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; a try. So far, I'm very impressed. It truly is the ultimate to-do list application for iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't go over the basics of what it does or how to use it. Watch these videos if you want a taste of its functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.screencastsonline.com/index_files/SCO0178-omnifocusbasics.php"&gt;OmniFocus Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.screencastsonline.com/index_files/SCO0180-omnifocuspt2.php"&gt;Advanced OmniFocus and iPhone Client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes OmniFocus better than a simple to-do list is that it organizes next actions in two dimensions: by project and by context. A project is some list of actions. For example, if I want to take my wife out for dinner and music this weekend, I might create this project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take Pebble out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out what bands are playing this weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check with Pebble to see which band is her favorite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy tickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make dinner reservations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get directions to restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get directions to venue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call babysitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot to do, and this is only one of dozens of projects that are active at any time. But what makes all this stuff manageable is assigning the actions to contexts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out what bands are playing this weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy tickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get directions to restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get directions to venue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check with Pebble to see which band is her favorite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make dinner reservations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call babysitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time I'm at my computer and bring up OmniFocus, I'll see "Find out what bands are playing this weekend" as the next available action for this project, and I'll (I hope) take care of it. Then the next time I open OmniFocus on my phone, I'll see "Check with Pebble..." and take care of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You plan using projects, but you execute using contexts. Contexts are the key to actually getting things done, rather than just leaving those actions languishing in dozens of lists you never look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killer feature of OmniFocus is the synchronization between the desktop application and the iPhone application. I like that I can do all my planning at my desktop, then when I get in my car, I can quickly bring up the Errands list on my iPhone to see what I can pick up on the way to wherever I'm going. Or while in a meeting, I can quickly enter items into the phone and then process them later at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of synchronization is that it is sometimes slow. My iPhone sometimes takes several minutes to complete a synchronization through MobileMe. You can use the app while it is synching, so the synchronization delay is more of a minor annoyance than a major source of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OmniFocus is designed to support the GTD system, and while it is adaptable to other productivity systems, adherents of other systems may not like it. For example, it does not give a way to prioritize tasks in the way that Franklin-Covey devotees would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand what OmniFocus does not do. It is not a calendar or scheduling application (use iCal or Entourage for that). It is a personal organization system; it is not suitable for managing teams. It is not a project-tracking system. It is not a communication tool. It is just a tool for keeping track of all the things you want to do, and helping you do them with minimal fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OmniFocus is powerful, but also pretty complicated. You definitely need to watch the tutorial videos and read the &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt; book to figure out what the hell this thing does. The effort pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OmniFocus is a little pricey ($100 to get it for both desktop and iPhone), but I'm very happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: This review is based upon version 1.6.1 of the OmniFocus desktop app, and version 1.2.3 of the iPhone app.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="review"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="omnifocus"></category><category term="gtd"></category></entry><entry><title>The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/skeptics-guide-universe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-26T12:44:57-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-26T12:44:57-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-05-26:/skeptics-guide-universe.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.theskepticsguide.org' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.theskepticsguide.org/images/banner/sgu_200x200_cruise.jpg'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.theskepticsguide.org' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.theskepticsguide.org/images/banner/sgu_200x200_cruise.jpg'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="podcast"></category><category term="favorites"></category></entry><entry><title>Twitter Is About Content, Not Contact</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/twitter-about-content-not-contact.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-20T12:37:23-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-20T12:37:23-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-05-20:/twitter-about-content-not-contact.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://undefinedvalue.com/sites/undefinedvalue.com/files/iStock_000001485226XSmall.jpg" alt="Toy Bird"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is getting a lot of attention from the mainstream media.  A lot of people are trying it out, but they don't understand what they are supposed to do with it, they don't see any value in it, and they give up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is getting a lot of attention from the mainstream media.  A lot of people are trying it out, but they don't understand what they are supposed to do with it, they don't see any value in it, and they give up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people fall into the trap of thinking of Twitter as a "social network," and so they just follow their real-world friends and people they would like to meet.  Unless you have exceptionally interesting friends, this is not going to give you a good Twitter experience.  Steve Lawson explains it better than I can: &lt;a href="http://www.stevelawson.net/wordpress/2009/03/twitter-sucks-so-change-your-friends/"&gt;Twitter sucks, so change your friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't think of Twitter as being like Facebook, or like an instant messenger.  Think of it more like YouTube.  It is a place where you go to consume content, 140 characters at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be very selective about who you follow. Don't just follow your friends or celebrities.  Follow good writers, especially those skilled at brevity.  Comedians and comedy writers are often great tweeters, as jokes fit well in this format.  However, don't count on your favorite comedian being a good twitterer: many use Twitter only to plug their appearances or DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if you follow too many people, other Twitter users will assume you are a spammer or other not-really-serious user, and will ignore you. Being selective is an important part of finding the right "community" within Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Twitter users complain because nobody is following them. Don't expect people to follow you, unless you create really interesting tweets. Nobody cares what you had for breakfast or how long your flight has been delayed. And don't expect celebrities to respond to your messages: they have so many followers that they can't possibly pay attention to what the followers say to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For suggestions about how to recognize and create good tweets, see this Washington Post article: &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/18/AR2009051802870.html"&gt;Short(est) Stories: The Art of Twitterature Means Making 140 Characters Count&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a group of friends or co-workers who keep in touch via Twitter, that's great.  But for most of us, Twitter is best used as a read-only medium.  Leave the writing to the people who have something to say, and otherwise just enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong-history-programming-languages.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-08T17:13:36-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-08T17:13:36-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-05-08:/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong-history-programming-languages.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is great: &lt;a href="http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html"&gt;A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is great: &lt;a href="http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html"&gt;A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category><category term="funny"></category><category term="favorites"></category></entry><entry><title>Stack Overflow Moderator Voting Now Open</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-06T11:26:16-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-06T11:26:16-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-05-06:/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; user, you should be aware that &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/"&gt;voting is open&lt;/a&gt; for a new moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

A few have done something of value: for example, &lt;a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/Menubar-Countdown.shtml"&gt;Softpedia&lt;/a&gt; created their own &lt;a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/Menubar-Countdown-Screenshot-54783.html"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most of the other sites have simply copied-and-pasted the text from MacUpdate or Apple, and put their own advertising and branding around it. This strikes me as being pretty scummy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menubar Countdown is freeware, licensed under the GPL, and I have no complaint about them redistributing the app itself. What bothers me is that they copy the descriptions and other text verbatim (which is probably a copyright violation). They don't review the app. They don't promote it. They don't make it easier for users to find it. They do nothing of value; they simply siphon away attention to make a tiny profit for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might say that these other sites are somehow "helping" me by copying my work and pasting it all over the Internet without my consent. I'll refer those people to Merlin&amp;nbsp;Mann's &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2009/04/10/free-me"&gt;blog&amp;nbsp;post&lt;/a&gt; on that subject.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Enabling FastCGI for PHP on Ubuntu</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/enabling-fastcgi-php-ubuntu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-02T08:44:35-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-02T08:44:35-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-05-02:/enabling-fastcgi-php-ubuntu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm setting up a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server"&gt;virtual private server&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I started with a minimal Ubuntu 8.10 image and installed all the LAMP stuff. Things went smoothly until I decided to try to enable FastCGI for Drupal. Googling for things like "ubuntu apache php fastcgi" results in zillions of links to suggested methods, all of which were very complicated and required digging through docs.  I figured there had to be a simple way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of research, I finally did stumble upon what I wanted.  My problem was that I was googling for "ubuntu", when I should have been googling for "debian".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Repeat the alarm until the user acknowledges it. (Currently, the alarm just goes off once.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support Growl notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow user to choose an alert sound other than the default system alert sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide option to log out and/or shutdown when timer expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide option to launch an application or an AppleScript when timer expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow user to specify the output format (so that a user could, for example, have it display "4m, 3s" instead of 00:04:03.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-click start: bypass the Settings dialog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animated "alarm is going off" display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow user to specify an ending date and time, rather than a time interval&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide option to not display seconds (continuous animation is distracting to some, and removing seconds would save some menubar real estate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to implement very many of these, if any. What I like about Menubar Countdown is its simplicity, both in terms of user interface and in terms of implementation. It's only a couple hundred lines of code, and I'd like to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="menubarcountdown"></category></entry><entry><title>Lumpkin 400 Storage Rocks!</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/lumpkin-400-storage-rocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-27T16:55:24-04:00</published><updated>2009-04-27T16:55:24-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-04-27:/lumpkin-400-storage-rocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to give a quick plug to &lt;a href="http://www.lumpkin400storage.com"&gt;Lumpkin 400 Storage&lt;/a&gt; in Dahlonega, Georgia.

&lt;p&gt;Todd apolgized that he didn't have any trucks available (the end of the month is a busy time), but he'd have his trailer with him on Monday, so I should call him and he'd give me and a mower a ride. &lt;em&gt;No charge.&lt;/em&gt; We got the mower moved this morning, and I forced him to take twenty bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

While some automated solutions for moving from Blogger to Drupal are available, I decided it would be better to do it all by hand. This gives me a chance to pick only the Best of Undefined Value, and to do some editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not really that hard.  Just click the edit button for the old post, select all, copy, click my "Create Story" bookmark, paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only tedious part is setting the date. The old site has dates in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM format, whereas Drupal wants YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, so I can't just copy and paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there's not much good stuff on the old site, so I hope to have the &lt;strong&gt;Monthly archive&lt;/strong&gt; block on the left filled in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blogging"></category><category term="admin"></category></entry><entry><title>Fisher Bullet Space Pen: Almost Perfect</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/fisher-bullet-space-pen-almost-perfect.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-22T11:06:28-04:00</published><updated>2009-04-22T11:06:28-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-04-22:/fisher-bullet-space-pen-almost-perfect.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, while visiting the Kennedy Space Center my parents bought me a &lt;a href="http://www.spacepen.com/matteblackshuttlespacepen.aspx"&gt;Fisher Space Pen&lt;/a&gt;.

At the time, I thought it was cool because it could write upside down, and because it had been designed for astronauts.  I don't know where that first pen is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I've been eyeing the &lt;a href="http://www.spacepen.com/bullet.aspx"&gt;"bullet" Space Pens&lt;/a&gt; whenever I go into Office Depot. Spending twenty bucks on a ballpoint pen seemed like an unnecessary extravagance, so I held out for a long time. However, seeing the pen mentioned on &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda"&gt;43 Folders&lt;/a&gt; pushed me over the edge, and I finally bought one, in chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's almost perfect. I love the size and shape: it easily goes into and out of a pocket. When you remove the cap and put it on the other end, the result is a full-size nicely weighted and balanced pen. It feels good in the hand. Holding it and looking at it just makes me smile, as it is such a nice example of elegant engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I don't like about it is the ballpoint cartridge. I don't find myself in zero G or underwater very often, so I don't really need the whole pressurized-magic-ink thing. I find I have to press down a little harder than I'd like to get the ink to flow while writing. It's better than the typical 25&amp;#xa2; disposable ballpoint, but when I'm scribbling on an index card, I'd like smoother ink flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's too bad they can't offer a terrestrial version of the Space Pen, with the same form factor but with gel ink. (Maybe I'll experiment with putting a Pilot G2 cartridge into my Space Pen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's really a minor quibble. The Bullet Space Pen is easily worth the twenty bucks, and I'll probably buy another as a backup. We astronauts value redundancy, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, whenever the topic of the Space Pen comes up, some know-it-all will note that the American space program spent millions of dollars developing a high-tech pen that writes in zero-G vacuum while the Russians decided to simply use pencils. The story is not true: see &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/spacepen.asp"&gt;Snopes.com&lt;/a&gt; for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; A commenter provided a link to http://www.scarysharp.com/?p=441, which provides a solution for those who would like gel ink in their bullet pens.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not a paid shill. I figured I'd post my thoughts about it, in case others are considering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many, many diets and weight-loss programs out there. I'm not an expert on any of them; I'm just a guy who wanted his pants to fit again. Here are the things that made me choose NutriSystem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy: they send me food, and I eat it. I don't have to count calories, carbs, fat grams, etc. I don't have to spend time preparing special meals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not a radical diet. The basic idea is to eat small portions, and avoid saturated fat and "bad carbs" (sugar, white bread, etc.). You supplement the food they send you with fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals. It's normal food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No meetings or counseling required. I'm sure social support is great for a lot of people, but that kind of thing is a big negative for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works for me because it takes advantage of my laziness. I don't have to plan meals. I don't have to look at nutritional labels. I don't have to spend time cooking, other than popping something into the microwave for 90 seconds. All I have to do is pull my next meal out of a box every few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I'm eating only about a thousand calories a day, I rarely feel hungry. On the plan, you eat a meal six times per day, so even though the portions are small, you always feel like you've just eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people complain about the cost (over three hundred dollars a month), but it's actually cheaper than the company cafeteria and restaurant fare I used to eat daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people simply can't stand the food. I'm not a picky eater, so I don't mind. With the extra fruit and vegetables, I'm actually eating much tastier food than I did when my meals came from restaurants. It may not be the best-tasting food in the world, but it's not bad, and I like the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently took a week-long vacation, and ate "normally" during that week (that is, I didn't eat the NutriSystem stuff). I didn't lose any weight that week, but I didn't gain any either, so I'm optimistic that I'm developing good eating habits as a result of the plan, and will be able to keep the weight off when I reach my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lost about twenty pounds so far. I've got about thirty more pounds to lose to reach my goal weight. I'll let you know if NutriSystem gets me there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="nutrisystem"></category></entry><entry><title>Drupal Rocks</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/drupal-rocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-18T12:51:15-04:00</published><updated>2009-04-18T12:51:15-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-04-18:/drupal-rocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first dabbled in web development back in the mid 1990's.

Back in those dark times, you created web sites by writing raw HTML, or by writing C or Perl CGI scripts. You spent about 1% of your time creating interesting content and behavior, and 99% of your time dinking with site layout, page layout, link updates, database administration, and other "plumbing" issues. I decided web development wasn't for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As years have passed, I've dabbled with some of the techologies that were supposed to make web development better: ASP, JSP, PHP, ASP.NET, Rails, Django, etc. While these eliminated some of the tedium of development, they also added a lot of complexity. Those technologies give you tools for building a web site, but they don't give you a web site. You still spent 1% of your time on creativity and 99% of your time on plumbing. A "real web site" still required a team of programmers, designers, and editors to create and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've set up a few wikis. Those are nice in that they are easy to set up, and then the users can create content. Wikis are awesome for providing a collaborative publishing environment. The downside is that they all look ugly; you wouldn't want to use them for general-public web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I've stuck with writing raw HTML for my personal web sites. This caused my sites to suffer, because writing raw HTML for an entire site sucks, especially if you want to provide navigation links, multi-column layout, headers and footers, and other niceties.  My &lt;a href="http://capablehands.net"&gt;Capable Hands Technologies, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; web site kept its "Under Construction" home page for two years, because it just didn't seem to be worth the effort to put something there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then a few months ago, a friend told me he had set up a site using &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, and it was pretty cool. I finally tried it out a couple of weeks ago, and I am amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you do is unpack a tarball on a web site, create a MySQL database, fill in a few parameters (site name, logo, etc.), and &lt;em&gt;bingo!&lt;/em&gt;, you have a real web site, with a nice layout, front page, navigation menus, articles, RSS feed, user accounts, multi-user blogs, forums, file uploads, and a zillion other things I haven't even looked at yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal provides a great out-of-the-box experience, but there is a whole community providing additional modules (site features), themes (look-and-feel), and other stuff. So without writing any HTML or Perl, you can extensively customize your site with practically any feature you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drupal web site has a lot of documentation, but as with a lot of open-source projects, the documentation is not well organized, the tutorials are many-versions-old, and finding what you are looking for often takes forever. So I recommend that any new Drupal user read the book &lt;a href="http://www.usingdrupal.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Drupal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or something else like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside to Drupal is that it is written in PHP, which is one of those programming languages which is wildly popular but which also sucks tremendously. But I understand that the Drupal codebase is one of the few examples of well-written, well-structured PHP, so I may tinker with the code a bit to learn some things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Drupal is not the only "content management system" out there. WordPress or MovableType may meet your needs if you have a blog, or you may want something like Joomla or Zope instead of Drupal. The real lesson (for me) is that writing whole pages in HTML is something we don't need to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this old dog has learned some new tricks, and &lt;em&gt;Undefined Value&lt;/em&gt; is now running on Drupal. As I learn more about Drupal, I'll be adding features. I apologize in advance for anything I screw up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="drupal"></category></entry><entry><title>For Mac Users Who Use Firefox</title><link href="http://undefinedvalue.com/mac-users-who-use-firefox.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-17T20:57:07-04:00</published><updated>2009-04-17T20:57:07-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristopher Johnson</name></author><id>tag:undefinedvalue.com,2009-04-17:/mac-users-who-use-firefox.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you use Firefox on a Mac, you must change its theme to &lt;a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/themes_3.html"&gt;GrApple&amp;nbsp;Delicious&amp;nbsp;(blue)&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I want to make contact with other people who care about the things I care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to be able to go back and review what I was thinking in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For potential clients and employers, I want to have a collection of writings that demonstrate that I'm smart and that I take my work very seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to exercise my rudimentary website design and administration skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't expect to become a top blogger or generate ad revenue or become an influential thought leader. However, I do want people to read what I write, so I want to attract readers and keep the quality high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I have decided to narrow the focus of this blog. Up to now, I think the audience of &lt;em&gt;Undefined Value&lt;/em&gt; has consisted of these segments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who are not software developers, but who are interested in software and information technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private pilots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friends and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I'm going to concentrate on the first two groups. I haven't flown for a couple of years, so I don't have much to say to pilots anymore. The friends and family can be served via &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=552697319&amp;amp;ref=name"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.net/"&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean I won't occasionally post a picture of my dogs or re-tell a good fart joke I overheard. It just means that I'm going to focus on things that are of interest to "technology people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be both a teacher and a learner, so I'll be posting articles that share what I've learned but which also invite commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

The basic idea is that you work in focused 25-minute bursts, with short breaks between bursts.  You are supposed to use a kitchen timer to avoid getting distracted by looking at the clock.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, as a computer guy I'd like my timer to be on my computer.  I looked around for a Mac application that would provide an unobtrusive 25-minute countdown timer, but I didn't find any that I liked.  So I decided to write my own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://capablehands.net/menubarcountdown"&gt;Menubar Countdown&lt;/a&gt; is the result of that effort.  It displays a countdown timer on the right side of the menu bar.  It has menu items that allow you the user to start, stop, or resume the timer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are three options for what you want to happen when the timer reaches 00:00:00:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play the system alert sound (which I never notice).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display an alert window (which is effective, but you may not like the abrupt interruption).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak.  This is my favorite option.  You can specify what you want the application to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's free software, distributed under the terms of the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Source code is included.  Other neophyte Cocoa programmers might find it useful as an example of using such classes as NSStatusBar, NSStatusItem and NSUserDefaultsController, or for measuring absolute time in a Mac application.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can download the application from my snazzy new corporate web site: &lt;a href="http://capablehands.net/menubarcountdown"&gt;Menubar&amp;nbsp;Countdown product page&lt;/a&gt;.

I've been really hating my job for the last twelve months or so.  I've wondered why.  After all, I'm getting paid well to work on software.  This is my dream job, isn't it?  Why can't I enjoy it?  And if I can't enjoy it, why can't I just be happy …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I've been really hating my job for the last twelve months or so.  I've wondered why.  After all, I'm getting paid well to work on software.  This is my dream job, isn't it?  Why can't I enjoy it?  And if I can't enjoy it, why can't I just be happy that I'm not unemployed or flipping burgers?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While sitting in the car dealership service lounge today, I watched a &lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/03/stuart_brown_play.php"&gt;TEDTalk about the importance of play&lt;/a&gt;.  During that video, it hit me:  I hate my job because I never get to play anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I say &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, I don't mean playing ping-pong in the storeroom or having Nerf gunfights with my co-workers.  &lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; is about curiosity, exploration, and imagination.  That's what I've always liked about software development: the opportunity to explore different solutions, to try out new ideas, and to learn interesting things from other people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the past year, there has been none of that.  My job has mostly been about fixing bugs.  There have been a few new features to add, but they have all been uninteresting and uninspiring.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This may sound like whining, but lack of play really does take a toll on productivity.  We have several smart people on the team, and yet we are way beyond schedule and over budget.  I'm sure that a major reason for that is the fact that nobody is having any fun.  Just putting your head down and charging forward may sound like an admirable way to handle an unpleasant situation, but it stifles creativity and makes it difficult to imagine better solutions.  When there is no opportunity to be smart, everyone just gets more stupid.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Play should not be considered a luxury reserved for children.  The mind &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; play, just like it needs sleep.  Without it, performance suffers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I honestly can't remember the last time we did any brainstorming or drew things on whiteboards or talked about abstractions or joked about how to re-implement the whole system in some obscure programming language.  All we do is write code, and contrary to what some people believe, writing code is the least valuable thing a developer does.  It's the thinking behind the writing that makes us more than mere typists, and we aren't doing enough of that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know the solution to this problem.  I just hope that after the current projects are finished, I'll remember how my job is supposed to feel.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My wife &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristopherjohnson/3149067712/"&gt;Pebble&lt;/a&gt; is the most amazing person I've ever met.  She's smart.  She's kind.  She's giving.  She's forgiving.

Most of all, she's open in a way I thought nobody could be.  Marriage and life aren't always wonderful, but she's a wonderful wife, and I know I've chosen the right partner.  We grow closer every day, and I honestly can't remember what my life was like before I met her.  (I'm pretty sure it sucked.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For my birthday, she bought me the complete collection of &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; movies on Blu-ray.  I didn't even ask for it.  How cool is that?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My stepson &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristopherjohnson/2915112920/"&gt;Bailey&lt;/a&gt; is about to become ten years old.  Like his mother, his emotions and thoughts are always right at the surface, so I always know where I stand with him.  He is sometimes incredibly cute, and other times he's apparently possessed by Satan, but I know we'll always love one another.  He loves his new grandma and grandpa (my parents), and enjoys spending time with his new cousins (my nieces).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also got a puppy.  He's a Yorkshire Terrier named &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristopherjohnson/2619799174/"&gt;Mouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and he thinks he owns the house.  I believe there is nothing cuter than a Yorkie puppy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Our little cabin in the woods is nice, but we all agree that we'd like more space, and we're all getting tired of driving two hours a day to get to and from our occupations, so we're probably going to be moving closer to Atlanta some time this year.  But we're not in a hurry: we do like our little cabin in the woods.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My forties are shaping up to be a lot better than my twenties and thirties were.  Life is good.  (But I occasionally complain about it anyway.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've done more traveling in the past year than any other.  My wife and I went to Waikiki for our honeymoon, and also visited Pensacola and the Grand Canyon.  I went alone to Australia for three weeks on business, finally putting my passport to use.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Career-wise, I'm in a bit of a rut.  I had hoped to do some job searching this year, but with the economy the way it is, I consider myself fortunate to have the contracting gig that I have.  I'll try to acquire some new skills this year.  Maybe next year...

For an iPhone app that I'm working on, I want to be able to save the screen image to the Photos album.  My first attempt at this was complicated: I created a color space, a bitmap context, a &lt;tt&gt;CGImage&lt;/tt&gt;, and finally a &lt;tt&gt;UIImage&lt;/tt&gt;, copying and pasting most of the code from the &lt;em&gt;Quartz 2D Programming Guide&lt;/em&gt;.  Unfortunately, it didn't work; I kept getting BAD_ACCESS signals when I called &lt;tt&gt;UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum()&lt;/tt&gt;, even though it looked to me like everything was correct.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After Googling for a bit for known issues with UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum, I ran across a far easier solution to the problem.  Here are the methods I ended up with:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="overflow: scroll; border: 1px solid #666"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
// Create an image for the view and save it to the Photos library
- (void)savePhotoOfView:(UIView *)view
{
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(view.bounds.size);
    [view drawRect:view.bounds];
    UIImage *image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();

    UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(image,
                                   self,
                                   @selector(savedPhotoImage:didFinishSavingWithError:contextInfo:),
                                   NULL);
}

// Called by UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum() when it completes
- (void)   savedPhotoImage:(UIImage *)image
  didFinishSavingWithError:(NSError *)error
               contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo
{    
    NSString *message = @"This image has been saved to your Photos album";
    if (error) {
        message = [error localizedDescription];
    }
    UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:nil
                                                    message:message
                                                   delegate:nil
                                          cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                                          otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [alert show];
    [alert release];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These just call the view's &lt;tt&gt;drawRect&lt;/tt&gt; method to create an image, save the image to the Photos library, and then pop up an alert box to let the user know what happened.

I am so thankful for the existence of the iPhone.  Twenty years ago, if you'd told me I'd be holding a pocket-sized computer that had a high-resolution touchscreen, a wireless always-on connection to the Internet, and a library of Hollywood movies, I wouldn't have believed it.  The fact that it can make phone calls is nice too, but I frankly don't care too much about that feature.  All those idiots who keep asking "Why would anyone spend $500 on a &lt;em&gt;phone&lt;/em&gt;?!?" are really missing the point.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(See &lt;a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=iphone"&gt;The iPhone is a piece of shit, and so is your face&lt;/a&gt; for an alternative opinion.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Writing little apps for the iPhone is the only thing keeping me from giving up on software completely. (Well, OK, I guess the mortgage has something to do with that also.)  At work, I'm starting my third year of maintaining a horrible soul-crushing legacy application, and it's hard for me to maintain the appropriate level of Give-a-Shit.  Playing with the iPhone SDK helps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm working on an application now that I hope to put in the App Store in a few weeks.  No, it's not &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2008/12/to-do-list-application-update-1.html"&gt;my to-do list app&lt;/a&gt;.  I'd rather not write about it yet, because it is the kind of thing someone else could create during an uninterrupted weekend, but once it's done, I'll start the marketing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My first app, &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2008/11/jacksorbetter-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch.html"&gt;JacksOrBetter&lt;/a&gt;, has not been wildly successful.  I've sold about 200 copies worldwide.  That's not surprising, as it's a simple game, and there are a few dozen other casino-style card games available in the App Store, many of which are free.  I didn't expect to make money with that game; I just wanted to go through the process of developing something and putting it up for sale.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I doubt my next app will bring in a windfall either, but that's fine with me.  I'm having fun, and people are using software I've written.  That's why I got into this business in the first place.

A few days ago, I bought a 15-inch MacBook Pro.  For those of you keeping score, that brings the number of Macintoshes in our household to five.  We also have two iPhones and several iPods.  I wish the local Apple Store had some sort of customer loyalty program.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I bought this machine for work.  (My wife will snicker at this statement, but it's true.)  I've been toting a &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2006/11/toshiba-tecra-m7-tablet-pc.html"&gt;Toshiba tablet&lt;/a&gt; with Windows XP to the office for the past couple of years, but with each passing month, I've hated it more.  Most of my development work has been for Linux, and I haven't needed Windows much.  So, I've decided I'll finally ditch PC's for good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will have VMWare Fusion running Windows, Linux, and FreeDOS.  For a contract programming gig a couple years ago, I &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2006/10/my-next-windows-laptop.html"&gt;ran Windows on my 13-inch MacBook with Parallels&lt;/a&gt;, and that worked pretty well, so I'm confident that a beefier Mac with VMWare can handle all my Windows needs from now on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The new Pro is pretty.  For the past few days, I've been preparing it for service by installing all the necessary software.  On Monday, I'll take it to work, but I'll also take my old Toshiba for a few days until I'm sure the new machine can take its place.

I now think there should be a Stack Overflow badge for people who have appeared on the podcast, either as questioners or as guests.

Today I was delighted to discover that Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky discussed my recorded question on &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/podcast-34/"&gt;Episode 34 of the Stack Overflow podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  I now think there should be a Stack Overflow badge for people who have appeared on the podcast, either as questioners or as guests.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here is my question (without the &lt;i&gt;ums&lt;/i&gt; and pauses):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is often said that the primary role of a software development manager is to insulate developers from the customers, users, executives, and other people involved with the project.  However, I have often found that talking to customers and users gives me a lot of useful information that isn't in the specs about what the true requirements and goals of the project are.  To what extent should developers interact with customers, users, and other stakeholders?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Jeff and Joel had some good comments.  What follows are my own thoughts about the topic.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I started out as a developer, I was very introverted, content to just sit in my cubicle and interact with the world via e-mail.  However, as I acquired more responsibility, I had to start talking to executives.  Eventually, I became a development lead, and had to meet with actual customers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was terrified, but it was my job, so I did it.  It turned out to be a lot easier than I expected.  It was even pleasant.  It turned out that customers weren't morons who wanted to torture software developers; they just wanted us to deliver software that suited their needs, which is exactly what I wanted too.  I looked forward to the customer meetings, which always invigorated me and got me more excited about working on the software.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Based upon that experience, I've encouraged other developers to get involved with people outside the team, and I've often wished my employers would do more to get us out of our offices and into the users' facilities.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there are costs and risks associated with customer/user interaction.  The time you spend with customers and users is time you aren't writing code, so if you do too much you lose productivity.  Developers by nature are usually willing to do whatever it takes to solve problems, so there is the risk that a developer will commit to do something that shouldn't be done.  If customers get too chummy with developers, they may try to go around management, which is bad for everyone.  And finally, some developers have personality disorders that make them unsuitable for outside contact.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But still, I encourage all developers to try to get into positions where they can talk to customers and users.  It makes software development a lot more fun.

A surprising large number of people have asked me whether the toilets really do flush in the opposite direction in the Southern Hemisphere, due to the Coriolis Effect.  Well, the toilets I've seen in Australia don't swirl at all; there is a short but powerful swoosh of water that lasts only a second or two, with no rotation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/149/do-bathtubs-drain-counterclockwise-in-the-northern-hemisphere"&gt;The Straight Dope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/science/coriolis.asp"&gt;Snopes.com&lt;/a&gt;, and other authorities, the whole swirling-the-opposite-way thing is a myth.  Any rotation of water in a toilet, bathtub, sink, etc. is due to previous motion of the water, or direction of a water jet, or shape of the bowl, or other mundane reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But it is true that if you let go of something, it falls up into the air, because we're upside down.  I never would have guessed that was true.

I've never been much of a traveler or a tourist.  I don't get the thrill that others do from sightseeing or being away from home.  But having said that, I've gotta say I'm a little disappointed with how not-foreign Adelaide, Australia is.  I was hoping for a little adventure here on the opposite side of the world, but it's a lot like home.  It's as adventurous as visiting Vancouver.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I'm not on vacation, and all I've seen of Australia so far is the office where I'm working, and some stuff within walking distance of the hotel.  I'm hoping that next weekend I'll have a chance to see something outside the city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was flying over the Pacific on US Election Day, so I didn't get to vote or to watch what was going on.  I caught a little coverage on CNN during my layover in Auckland.  After arriving in Adelaide, it was straight to the office, but a couple of hours later, US networks started projecting the winner, and the Australians were all talking about it.  All the Australians I've talked to are elated about the US election result.  They don't understand the policy differences between the candidates or between the Democrat and Republican parties, but they are happy to see that America elected a black man to its highest office, and they are relieved that Bush's party will no longer be in power.  I don't know what the media coverage is like back home, but over here it is overwhelmingly positive toward Obama, and there is hope that America will start being benevolent again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My wife's been a trouper, complaining less than I expected about her new husband leaving her for three weeks on short notice.  We're keeping in touch via Skype, instant messenger, text messages, and the occasional insanely-expensive phone call.  Unfortunately, the timezone difference makes it difficult to keep in touch, as I'm sleeping during her day and vice versa.  The only good time for a conversation during the week is when she's getting up at 5:30 AM her time and I've gotten back to the hotel at 9:00 PM my time.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Australia is a nice place, and the Australians are great people.  But there's no place like home, and I look forward to getting back there.

Flying to Australia from the US is not a pleasant experience.  It takes a long time.  For me, it was a five-hour flight from Atlanta to San Francisco, then a fourteen-hour flight from San Francisco to Auckland, New Zealand, then another five-hour flight from Auckland to Adelaide, South Australia.  Including the layovers, the trip took over thirty hours.  It will be the same on the way back, but of course, I'll be a lot happier when I reach my destination then.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's expensive, too.  My business-class round-trip ticket was $15,000.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lucky for me, I flew Air New Zealand.  This is very nice, because their Business Premier-class travel is about as good as you can get without buying your own personal aircraft.  I was expecting a typical business-class seat, which gives you a few extra inches of legroom, but Air New Zealand gives each business-class passenger a very comfortable recliner, an ottoman, and in-flight entertainment system.  With the push of a button, the seat folds down forward and joins the ottoman to form a bed, so it's actually possible to get some restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My colleagues who flew United were very jealous.

There is a new web site for software developers to ask questions and get answers: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
I've been one of the site's beta testers for the past month, and I've been impressed with the quality of the information available on the site.  Of course, there are plenty of a-holes there, but I think it will become one of the top go-to sites for developers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What's cool about Stack Overflow:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's free (unlike some other programmer-question-and-answer sites).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple question-and-answer format keeps things focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting lets the good information rise to the top, and the spam disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing allows outdated information to be corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reputation system prevents newbies from screwing things up too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is now open to the public.  Please read &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq"&gt;the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; before participating, and please don't screw it up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/09/15.html"&gt;Joel Spolsky's explanation of how it should work&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001169.html"&gt;Jeff Atwood's blog entry&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, we couldn't get the SuperDrive to work.  Any disc we inserted would be ejected, without being recognized by the computer.  After a few days of struggling with this, we decided we'd take it back to the local Apple Store.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We live far away from civilization, and a trip to the Apple Store requires D-Day-like preparation.  So, the SuperDrive sat on the desk for a while.  Then my wife figured out the problem:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was upside-down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yep, we were trying to use the SuperDrive when it was &lt;em&gt;upside-down&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You see, Apple products aren't designed like other computer manufacturer's products.  Most products have a shiny logo on the top of the product, and the bottom looks like a piece of Soviet military hardware.  The MacBook Air SuperDrive has a shiny silver side, and a shiny side with an Apple logo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It never occurred to us that the logo-side would be the bottom.  She turned it logo-side-down, and now it works fine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We feel really smart for figuring that one out.  At least we didn't have to be told by a Genius at the Apple Store.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
South Australia is thirteen-and-a-half hours ahead of US Eastern time.  This has made it difficult to provide support from home, as they work while we sleep and vice versa.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We came up with a solution:  the people in the States will be working from 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM, which is 4:30 AM to 12:30 AM in Adelaide.  The people in Australia will show up at 7:00 AM their time (which is the earliest they are allowed into the building), giving us a few hours of overlapping duty.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, this week I get to see my wife and stepson for just a few minutes each morning (as they prepare for school/work) and each evening (when I get home around midnight).  That stinks, but I guess it's better than traveling to Australia myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

When you are contacted by a recruiter, they will give you a description of the job they want you to take, but they won't tell you the name of the employer.  This ensures that they will get their cut for their "assistance" if you eventually get the job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Luckily, recruiters are as lazy as the rest of us.  If you Google the description, you can usually find the job listing or company profile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't do this to screw recruiters out of their take.  If I am interested in the job, I'll go through the recruiter.  I just do it to save time; 90% of the jobs offered via recruiters are not worth pursuing.

I am often amazed at how little some of my colleagues know or care about their craft.  Something that constantly frustrates me is that people don't want to learn any more than they need to about the programming languages they use every day.  Many programmers seem content to learn some pidgin sub-dialect, and stick with that.  If they see a keyword or construct that they aren't familiar with, they'll complain that the code is "tricky."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What would you think of a civil engineer who shied away from calculus because it had "all those weird math symbols?"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not suggesting that we all need to become "language lawyers."  But if you make your living as a programmer, and claim to be a competent user of language X, then I think at a minimum you should know the following:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are all the keywords of the language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are all the valid syntactic forms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are memory, files, and other operating system resources managed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is the official language specification and library reference for the language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The last one is the one that really gets me.  Many programmers seem to have no idea that there is a "specification" or "standard" for any particular language.  I still talk to people who think that Microsoft invented C++, and that if a program doesn't compile under VC6, it's not a valid C++ program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers these days have it easy when it comes to obtaining specs.  Newer languages like C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. all have their documentation available for free from the vendors' web sites.  Older languages and platforms often have standards controlled by standards bodies that demand payment for specs, but even that shouldn't be a deterrent: the C++ standard is available from ISO for $30 (and why am I the only person I know who has a copy?).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Programming is hard enough even when you do know the language.  If you don't, I don't see how you have a chance.

Some may think it's a little sad that we did this, but think about it this way:  what is the likelihood that each of us would have found another person who would have thought this was a great way to spend an evening?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By the way, this is the first time we've played games like this.  And my wife probably won't immediately recognize the Star Trek allusion in this post's title.  She's not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; geeky, which is a very good thing.

This is Mouse, the newest member of our family.  He's a twelve-week-old Yorkshire Terrier.  My wife says I've been beaming with a smile ever since I first held him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My wife and I have been talking about getting a dog for a while.  We were thinking about getting something like a Boxer.  We decided we should wait before getting something so big.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last week, my wife suggested she'd like to get a Yorkshire Terrier or a Miniature Schnauzer.  As luck would have it, on Friday a friend needed to stop at a pet store to get a new leash for his dog, and so I saw some yorkies and a mini schnauzer.  A smart worker at the store noticed my interest, and immediately put a yorkie in my hands.  It was very cute, but I was able to give it back.  I sent a text to my wife telling her I'd seen them, and she texted back that I should buy one immediately.  I stayed strong, and didn't buy one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The following day, we went to the store together.  Before we went in, we decided we would look at the dogs, but would have lunch before committing to anything.  We played with a yorkie (who would eventually come home with us) and a schnauzer.  Pebble had wanted a schnauzer before going in, but the yorkie had a lot more personality.  We told the salesman we would think about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the way to lunch, it was obvious we had both already decided we wanted that yorkie.  Pebble came up with the name "Mouse," and from that point he was &lt;em&gt;our dog&lt;/em&gt;.  She suggested we go back right away to pick him up, before anyone else got him, but I wanted to stick to the lunch-first plan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To my shock and horror, when we returned to the store, another customer was playing with &lt;em&gt;our dog&lt;/em&gt;!  She was clearly very interested.  I was tempted to immediately shout "We want him, we'll pay right now," but decided the wiser course was to wait and see what happened.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thankfully, the other woman wanted to think about it, so as soon as the dog was back in the pen, I pounced and told the salesman we'd take him.  The other woman was crestfallen, but you know, we saw him first.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's great to have a pet again.  My wife had cats when we met, but I have severe allergies to cats, so she had to choose between me and them.  Luckily, she had family members willing to take the cats.  I have mild allergic reactions to dogs, but yorkies are hypo-allergenic, and I haven't had any reactions to Mouse.

I have a dirty little secret: I have used the same password for my web site accounts for a very long time.  Yahoo!, Google, Hotmail, Amazon, all of them &amp;mdash; same password, unchanged for years.  I've always known this was a bad idea, but I didn't want the trouble of creating unique passwords and changing them periodically.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That has changed. After hearing the description of &lt;a href="http://passwordmaker.org"&gt;PasswordMaker&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/"&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; podcast, I decided to finally take action. Unlike a lot of other "password manager" applications, PasswordMaker doesn't require you to store your passwords anywhere or synchronize them between machines. Instead, it uses a hash algorithm to generate a unique password for each site, but you don't have to store anything anywhere.  It can be used with any web browser, on any platform.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So now I'm changing all my passwords on all the web sites I use. I may even change them periodically.

As indicated in previous posts, I got married on April 5.  Although it was obviously one of the most important events in my life, I haven't written much about it, due to lack of free time.  So, here's all the stuff I should have written during the past few weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Wedding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pebble and I both wanted a simple wedding.  Our first idea was to only invite immediate family.  But then we figured we should also invite our neighbors.  And if we were inviting the neighbors, we should also invite close friends.  And if we were having that many guests, maybe we should have a band.  So, we ended up with about 50 people attending the wedding.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The wedding and reception were at &lt;a href="http://theoarhouse.com/"&gt;The Oar House&lt;/a&gt;, a nice little restaurant that happens to be about a mile from our house.  The restaurant's property borders the Chestatee River, so we hoped to have the ceremony on the river bank, followed by dinner reception.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pebble is an ardent do-it-yourselfer, so we spent a lot of time at craft stores getting all the stuff needed for decorations, place settings, centerpieces, party favors, and so on.  We also spent a lot of time putting the stuff together, but we were able to draft family members to help with that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then, it rained on the wedding day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We were, of course, disappointed.  Due to the rain, we had to abandon the idea of the riverside ceremony, and instead hold it inside the reception tent.  We also had trouble getting good pictures in our wedding garb.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, in hindsight, the rain wasn't all bad.  It kept everybody inside the tent, which gave intimacy to the event.  I enjoyed spending the time with good friends, some of whom I haven't seen in years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We hired the band &lt;a href="http://emeraldrose.com/"&gt;Emerald Rose&lt;/a&gt; to perform.  They hold a special place in our memories, as Pebble invited me to see them on our second date.  Also, one of the band members is our next-door neighbor, and another band member is the husband of the woman who officiated, so we have a lot of connections.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As we left, Pebble and I both commented on how beautiful the whole thing was.  I give her full credit for how wonderful everything looked, but we were also happy that our friends and family seemed to enjoy it as much as we did.  The staff at the Oar House did a great job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Honeymoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the reception, we drove to a hotel near the airport.  The next morning, we flew to Honolulu.  It was a nine-hour flight.  We had both forgotten our Bose noise-cancelling headphones, so we picked up two pairs of Sony noise-cancelling headphones at the airport before the flight.  The headphones served us well, but we now have no idea where they are.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was surprised at how big Honolulu was; I had always thought of it as a small resort town, but driving through it felt like driving through Los Angeles.  We stayed at the &lt;a href="http://www.outriggerwaikikihotel.com/"&gt;Outrigger Waikiki&lt;/a&gt;, a hotel on Waikiki Beach.  We didn't get all checked-in and unpacked until around 5 PM Honolulu time, which is 11 PM Atlanta time, so all we did that first day was go out to dinner at Cheeseburger in Paradise (which had great coconut shrimp) and head back to the hotel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Kris Screws Up, Big-time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second day (Monday), we decided to spend the morning at the beach.  Pebble bought me a bodyboard and thought it would be fun to watch me drown myself while she sat on the beach.  As I walked down to the water, Pebble said "Don't lose your wedding ring," and I said "It won't come off; it's too tight."  I went out and played in the surf for a while, but didn't like the experience.  There were a lot of rocks on the bottom, and I smashed a couple of my toes pretty good (they were purple for the rest of the trip).  After getting a little sun, we headed back to the hotel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I laid down to take a nap, I reached for my wedding ring, and discovered it wasn't there!  We looked around the hotel room, but I knew I hadn't intentionally taken it off.  It was out in the ocean.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After apologizing to my wife profusely for several minutes, I got on the phone and called the jeweler to ask whether they could ship us a replacement ring.  Unfortunately, their computers were down, so they couldn't look up the records that day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the next few days, we did get an identical ring ordered and shipped to us in Hawaii.  I hope our sacrifice to the Polynesian gods will bring good fortune.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After Monday, it rained every day.  So we didn't spend much time at the beach or doing other touristy things.  But we enjoyed ourselves anyway.  We were newlyweds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We spent a couple of days driving along the north shore of Oahu.  It is a beautiful area, and not as densely populated as the Honolulu area.  We saw whales, sea turtles, and a sea lion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We spent some time with the Bedient family, friends of Pebble's who live in Honolulu.    The two girls, aged 19 and 21, decided they wanted tatoos, so Pebble and I accompanied them to the tattoo parlor.  They lobbied hard for me to get a tattoo as well - one suggestion was having "I lost my wedding ring" tattooed on my forehead - but I left still unmarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Return&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We really didn't want to come home.  Really, really, really did not want to come home.  It was a difficult adjustment to go from living like royalty to being normal people again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've discovered that the Sears wedding gift registry website sucks.  First, some people had trouble placing orders through the site.  Now, we've discovered that there is no way to find out who bought the gifts we've received.  So, if you sent us a gift through Sears, but haven't received a thank-you note, we're sorry.

While learning a new codebase, I was a little disturbed when I saw this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  enum IsVerifying {

  };

  enum IsOnline {

  };

  /* etc. (There are about a dozen more of these.) */
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And there …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: Geeky programmer content below.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While learning a new codebase, I was a little disturbed when I saw this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  enum IsVerifying {
    IsVerifyingFalse,
    IsVerifyingTrue
  };

  enum IsVerified {
    IsVerifiedFalse,

  };

  enum IsEnabled {

  enum IsOnline {
    IsOnlineFalse,
    IsOnlineTrue
  };

  /* etc. (There are about a dozen more of these.) */
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And there was a lot of verbose code for dealing with these types, such as
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  if (Verified()) {
    verified = IsVerifiedTrue;
  }
  else {
    verified = IsVerifiedFalse;
  }

  if (Enabled()) {
    enabled = IsEnabledTrue;
  }
  else {
    enabled = IsEnabledFalse;
  }

  /* etc. */
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What's wrong with using plain-old-Boolean values &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;, or 0 and 1?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, after poking around the code more, I did find the reason that the original programmer did this.  He has a lot of functions that take several flags as parameters, and something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  SetStates(IsVerifyingFalse,
            IsVerifiedTrue,
            IsEnabledTrue,
            IsActiveFalse,
            IsOnlineFalse);
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
is easier to understand than something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  SetStates(false, true, true, false, false);
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But still, &lt;i&gt;yyeeaagghh&lt;/i&gt; is the proper reaction to seeing something like this.

&lt;p&gt;
She kept that stance until she bought an iPhone.  Then she started looking more closely at the Mac, saying stuff like "I really like that interface," and "I like how it turns on instantly when you open it."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then she saw that &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; commercial - the one where the computer fits in a manila envelope.  For the first few weeks, she said it was cool, but she didn't really need one.  About a week ago, she started trying to convince me that it would be a practical purchase.  (I didn't need convincing; she was really trying to convince herself.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, she bought a MacBook Air.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, I can't really savor my victory.  I'm too jealous of her new toy.

Last year, I wrote of my &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2007/03/scons.html"&gt;initial impressions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.scons.org/"&gt;SCons&lt;/a&gt; for controlling software builds.  My initial impressions were positive, but even then I was wary of performance issues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A few months later, I wrote about &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2007/07/improving-scons-performance-for-msvc8.html"&gt;a performance problem with SCons and MSVC&lt;/a&gt;.  I was able to hack SCons to make things a little better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Things weren't bad for me, because I've been doing all my development on Linux, where SCons is pretty well-behaved.  But the Windows developers hated it.  SCons will build MSVC project files so that developers can edit and browse code through the IDE, but the builds are still controlled by SCons, and SCons was painfully slow on Windows.  As the codebase grew, SCons got slower and slower.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The boss put up with it for a while, but he finally decided that enough was enough.  I was ordered to find something better than SCons for our cross-platform builds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We weren't the only people dissatisfied with SCons.  The KDE team had tried SCons, found it lacking, then started their own Python-based build system based on SCons, which eventually became &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/waf/"&gt;Waf&lt;/a&gt;.  I looked at Waf briefly, but the immaturity of the project and lack of documentation turned me off.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I read that the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system"&gt;autotools&lt;/a&gt; system was starting to provide better support for Windows, but I didn't think that solution would go over well with the team members and leaders who passionately hate things that are too UNIX-ish.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, after reading that the KDE team finally settled on &lt;a href="http://www.cmake.org"&gt;CMake&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to give that a try.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've spent the last couple of days translating build scripts from SCons into CMake.  So far, I'm pretty pleased with the results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pros of CMake over SCons:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It generates real honest-to-goodness MSVC solution and project files that work as well as or better than those that Windows developers would create by hand.  The CMake developers don't treat Windows developers as second-class citizens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default compiler settings in the generated MSVC files and Makefiles are remarkably sane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has lots of functionality built in.  (In contrast, SCons often required lots of code to be written to do simple things.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides a simple mechanism for handling unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler support for hierarchical builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has the feel of something that has been used for real-world work. (In contrast,  SCons always felt like a grad student's summer project.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't have to go take a coffee break every time I need to do a build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cons:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't like CMake's syntax.  It's like they took the syntaxes of Make, Perl, Bourne shell, and BASIC, and mixed them all together.  (Please, people, stop inventing your own application-specific scripting languages!  Especially if you are going to invent one that sucks.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online documentation is poor.  You have to buy a $50 book if you want to figure things out in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it is cross-platform, you still have to write a lot of "IF( WINDOWS ) ... ELSE ..." code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has no built-in support for precompiled headers.  (But then again, neither did SCons.  As with SCons, you can use precompiled headers by writing some code.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm happy with the switch to CMake, and I'm sure the boss will be too.  But who knows; maybe next year I'll be writing yet another blog entry about the need to adopt a new build system.

I'm getting married.  You may congratulate me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I asked The Question, and she said yes.  I know you're supposed to buy an engagement ring first, and present it as part of the proposal, but I wasn't really prepared when the conversation happened.  So, the following day, we went out to shop for rings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After hitting a half-dozen jewelry stores, we selected a beautiful ring.  Of course, I'm a guy, so all jewelry is just shiny metal and sparkly rocks to me, but I was surprised when the one she liked is the one that I probably would have bought if she wasn't along for the trip.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was on Sunday.  I put down a 20% deposit on the ring, planning to move more money into my checking account on Monday so I could pay the balance on Tuesday. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Paying the deposit took a while.  The nice salesperson at the store spent several minutes trying to figure out the menus and commands in the computer system.  Then, when she tried to validate my check by TeleCheck, she had to call them and stay on the line for about twenty minutes before they cleared it.  She said they said that the holdup was due to my address recently changing.  I received a receipt, and I told them I'd be back on Tuesday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I made my checking-account deposit on Monday morning, and went back to the store around noon on Tuesday.  The nice salesperson from Sunday wasn't working on Tuesday, so nice salesperson #2 took my receipt, and spent several minutes trying to figure out (a) what I was buying and (b) how much I owed.  She eventually figured it out, and I wrote another check.  She ran my check through TeleCheck, and the answer came back: &lt;i&gt;Declined&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nice salesperson #2 asked if I had recently made a deposit.  I told her I had, but that the bank told me the funds would be available immediately.  She suggested I visit the bank to clear things up.  I asked repeatedly whether I could bring back a cashier's check or money order, but she wouldn't answer that question, instead repeatedly insisting that, because she had worked at a bank in the past, she knew that there &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be some kind of hold on my account.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So I went to the bank.  Nice bankerperson told me that all my funds are available, and there is no reason that my check should be declined.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So I went back to the jewelry store.  Nice salesperson #2 is heading out to lunch, so I had to explain the history of this transaction to nice salesperson #3, who then spent several minutes studying my receipt and looking up computer records to figure out (a) what I was buying and (b) how much I owed.  She ran my check through TeleCheck, and the answer came back: &lt;i&gt;Declined&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As she was walking out the door, nice salesperson #2 suggested that #3 call TeleCheck, which she does.  She's on the line for twenty minutes, but the only answer she gets is that I've been declined.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I asked whether I could just go to the bank and bring back a cashier's check, money order, or a briefcase full of cash.  She asked whether I have a debit card with me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I did have a debit card with me, but I was under the impression that it had a limit of $400 or something like that.  She swiped it through her card reader, and boom, thousands of dollars were exchanged for a sparkly rock.  Wow, technology is cool.  So now I own the ring, but have to wait a few days for it to be resized.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was easier to buy my last car than to buy this ring.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lessons learned:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TeleCheck can bite me.  I haven't used checks for retail items in a long time, but I thought a check would make sense for this large purchase.  TeleCheck's validation system wasted a couple hours of my time.  From now on, I'll just use credit cards for everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewelry store salespeople could use more training on their computer systems.  All three of the salespeople I observed seemed to randomly try every menu item until they got results that seemed reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm never getting married ever again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Another year has gone by.  I didn't really set many goals for myself last year, so I'm not disappointed by any failures (although I am disappointed that I didn't set any goals).  I lost 20 pounds and ran the Peachtree Road Race, but I've regained the 20 pounds.

&lt;p&gt;
The biggest change in my life is that the Match.com thing worked out and I am now part of an "us."  This is making me very happy.  We live in a newly-purchased old cabin in the woods.  I'm now spending my weekends doing yardwork and other handiwork, which is a big change from my old lifestyle.  I now have access to a chainsaw and will soon have a tiller.  At some point, I'm going to have to learn about wells so I can get rid of the sulfur smell in our water.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never understood why all the guys with wives and girlfriends never have any free time to hang out with us unencumbered guys.  Now I understand.  There's not much "me time" anymore, but I don't miss it.  (Love you, sweetie.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am practicing guitar whenever I have some free time.  I hope to be able to play some actual music by this time next year.  I also want to master the drums on Rock Band.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm going to start taking a self-portrait on each birthday.  I hope my deterioration will be very slow.  I haven't decided yet whether the beard is going to be a permanent part of my appearance.
&lt;/p&gt;

The term "death march" is commonly used for software projects that are behind schedule, over budget, have no end in sight, and yet must be completed.  There is a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-March-2nd-Yourdon-Press/dp/013143635X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200486804&amp;sr=8-1"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; with that title.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've recently become involved in one of these projects.  I should say "re-involved," because I was involved with the project a year and a half ago, and I quit.  As an independent contractor now, I feel less pain than the employees do: I get paid by the hour and can set my own schedule, whereas they have to work unpaid overtime, and they are shackled to their desks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, one of the developers had to go to a doctor.  The stress and long hours had led to high pulse rate and other signs of anxiety.  The doctor told him to go home and get some rest, which he did.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We're all glad that nothing more serious happened.  Managers express surprise that anyone would work himself so hard.  I've only been involved with this for a few days, but here's what I've observed:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements and UI design are still changing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work that was originally estimated to take three months has now been scheduled for completion in three weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A manager stops by every hour to get a status update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a couple of hour-long meetings every day.  Plans are changed during each meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, I can't imagine why anyone would feel pressure, with management being so "helpful."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He's young.  I remember when I was younger.  I tried to meet crazy deadlines.  I took it personally when managers demanded faster progress.  I blamed myself for everything that went wrong.  I worked myself sick.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, with a couple of decades of seasoning, I know better.  If you're involved in a death march, it is due to your managers' incompetence, not yours.  Work at a sustainable pace, and remember that no matter how loudly the managers are screaming, there is no need to sacrifice yourself for the good of the company.

The National Academy of Sciences has issued a report that documents the methods of science and the overwhelming evidence in support of the theory of evolution.  It also presents the arguments against the teaching of creationism and Intelligent Design in public-school science classes.  However, it also clearly outlines the reasons that a belief in evolution is not incompatible with a belief in God or with other religious beliefs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is available for download (PDF) from &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876"&gt;http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I personally find it repugnant that some religious fundamentalists are trying to erode this country's science-education programs.  They have convinced a large number of people that there is a large body of scientific evidence against evolution and that there is a debate in the scientific community about its validity.  They use fallacious arguments to present Intelligent Design as a logical "scientifically based" alternative.  They say that "good Christians" need to support inclusion of these teachings in our kids' science classes.  They want us to embrace ignorance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those people are dishonest and evil.  The information in this book can help us fight them.

&lt;p&gt;
If you are driving in the left lane on an interstate or other multi-lane highway, please check the following:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there cars right behind you, but no cars in front of you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you driving well below the posted speed limit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are people passing you on your right side?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you been driving dead even with the car to your right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you talking on the phone, eating, fixing your kids' hair, or engaging in any other activity that may distract you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there no possibility that you will pass anyone, ever?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you answer &lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt; to any of the above questions, then please get out of the left lane.  You don't belong there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And please, don't speed up when someone tries to pass you.  Highway driving is not a NASCAR-sanctioned event, and you won't lose any Winston Cup points if you let somebody get in front of you.

The two-year anniversary of my &lt;a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2005/11/private-pilot-checkride.html"&gt;private pilot checkride&lt;/a&gt; went by recently.  This has legal significance, as a pilot is not allowed to exercise the privileges of the certificate (license) unless one has had a checkride or a flight review in the past 24 months.  So, as of the end of this month, I can't fly again until I've had a flight review.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A flight review really isn't a big deal.  You are required to spend one hour on the ground and one hour in the air with a flight instructor, who will determine whether you are still a safe pilot.  However, since I haven't flown since January, I'll need a couple of refresher lessons before my review.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also need to renew my aviation medical certification, due to the blood-pressure medication I've recently been prescribed.  So that's another hurdle to negotiate before I can fly again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Right now, I have no plans to go back up in the air.  I have better things to do with my time and money.  I hope that I will get back into the left seat someday, but for now, I'm content to gaze up at the sky and say "It sure would be a nice day to fly."

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have collected a lot of books about rock guitar over the past 20 years, but I am getting more interested in jazz.  Can anyone recommend some good basic/intermediate books or interactive courses for learning jazz guitar?
&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike the Windows world, where operating systems upgrades are sources of frustration and loathing, among Mac users upgrades are met with enthusiastic interest. I've been using &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx"&gt;Leopard&lt;/a&gt; (Mac OS X 10.5) for a few days now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The performance improvements promised by Apple are real.  Everything feels snappier.  Spotlight is actually usable now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My favorite new feature is Spaces.  Some say "Big deal.  It's just a virtual desktop manager.  UNIX workstations have had those for years."  True, but it is an improvement over the original Expos&amp;eacute; feature.  Unlike other virtual desktops, it is well-integrated into the rest of the UI.  Dragging live windows between virtual workspaces is really cool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Time Machine is pretty cool too.  Again, some would say "Big deal. It's just a backup/restore application. I can do the same thing with rsync." What makes Time Machine special is its simplicity.  You plug an external drive in, and the Mac asks "Do you want to back up your main drive to this drive?"  If you answer "yes," then that's it: you now have automatic hourly, daily, and weekly backups. Unlike other backup systems, Time Machine keeps all these backups available, but conserves drive space by not making copies of files that have not changed from one backup to another.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Time Machine is one of those amazingly great things that seems obvious, now that somebody has done it. I expect Time Machine clones to appear for Windows and UNIX very soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I do have some complaints about Time Machine: the UI is a little hard to figure out the first time you see it (and there is no menu bar or online help available in the app), and my MacBook CPU usage goes to eleven for a couple of minutes every hour while it makes the backups.  I may turn off the automatic backups and switch to manual backups (right-click the backup drive and choose "Backup Now").
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The new version of the Safari web browser is a lot more usable than the previous version, but I went back to Firefox after a few days.  Firefox has more "power-user" features than Safari does, and I can't live without them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have mixed feelings about the "Leopard look." On one hand, brushed metal has pretty much disappeared, so we can rejoice. But there are other things that, while they look cool, actually make it more difficult to see important information: translucent menus, the 3D Dock, subtle folder icons, too-dark windows, etc.  But it's not as bad as Vista.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the whole, it's a solid upgrade. In a way, it is a bit of a letdown, because it is really just a polishing of an already-good system. Of its touted "300+ new features," few are going to change the way one uses their Mac.  I haven't found anything that makes me say "Wow!" but there are a lot of little new things that make me say "Hey, that's kinda neat."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For a good in-depth technical review of Leopard, see &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/1"&gt;the Ars Technica review&lt;/a&gt;.  From that review, it looks like it is a great time to be a Mac developer&amp;mdash;lots of cool new APIs and debugging aids. (Unfortunately, I'm still a Windows whore.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To sum everything up: the upgrade was definitely worth $129 and a few hours of time.  My only regret is that I didn't buy the "family pack" so that I could also upgrade my old iMac G5.  Is it time to buy a new iMac?

I've upgraded my MacBook from Tiger to Leopard.  I hit a couple of snags along the way; maybe this will help someone else avoid the same issues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
1.  When I first attempted to upgrade, the Installer wouldn't allow me to select my hard drive for the upgrade.  I have been using a copy of my original hard drive, and the copy was apparently not partitioned with "GUID Partition Table."  It was booting fine under Tiger, but apparently there are new rules for Leopard.  The installer offered to erase my drive for me and partition it correctly, but I didn't want to lose all my applications and data.  The moral:  when partitioning a new drive for use as a boot disk, click the &lt;b&gt;Options...&lt;/b&gt; button in Disk Utility's &lt;b&gt;Partition&lt;/b&gt; page and select "GUID Partition Table" (the default selection is "Apple Partition Table"). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
2.  After installation, the drive started booting, but then just sat on a blank blue screen for a long time.  This is apparently caused by an old version of Unsanity's Application Enhancer.  To remove this software and let Leopard boot, follow the "Solution 2" instructions given here: &lt;a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306857"&gt;http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306857&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
3.  My wireless Mighty Mouse didn't work at first.  The Bluetooth icon didn't show up in the System Preferences, and the menu bar showed the icon but the menu said that Bluetooth was unavailable.  After rebooting a couple times, Bluetooth magically reappeared and the mouse worked as before.
&lt;p&gt;
After getting over those little bumps, Leopard appears to be working fine, and it is worth noting that the serious problems would not have occurred if I was using the original Apple-installed hard drive and I had not installed any hacky software.  So, can't blame Apple.

I've never been good at keeping backups.  Back in the good old days, when all my data fit on one floppy disk, I made copies of those, but the first time I had to back up a 20-MB (yes, &lt;i&gt;megabyte&lt;/i&gt;) hard drive onto a stack of floppies, I gave up on backups.  As my hard drives have grown, the thought of spending time making huge backups have become more daunting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been lucky.  I've never had a hard drive crash, or lost a laptop, or otherwise been unpleasantly surprised.  I've never been taught a harsh lesson about the importance of backups.  For important files, I've e-mailed copies to myself, taking advantage of the practically unlimited free storage space provided by Yahoo! Mail and GMail.  However, if one of my hard drives ever died, it would take a very long time to re-install an OS and all my applications and settings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've always felt that I should be keeping backups, and with the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/"&gt;Mac OS X Leopard&lt;/a&gt; upgrade, I figured I should keep a backup of my Tiger installation in case Leopard turned out to be a lemon.  A &lt;a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/801607.html"&gt;recent post by jwz&lt;/a&gt; about backups prompted me to get serious.  His suggestion is basically to buy some extra hard drives and an external enclosure, make copies of your hard drives, and use &lt;a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/"&gt;rsync&lt;/a&gt; to periodically copy changes from your main drives to the backup copies.  This gives you a bootable backup drive, so if your real drive ever dies, you just pop the backup drive into your computer, and you're back in business.  jwz's advice is sound, and is easy to follow if you have a Mac or a Linux box.  It's a little expensive to buy so many spare drives, but the convenience of having bootable backups is worth it to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, it is not as easy to back up a Windows machine.  You can use rsync if you have &lt;a href="http://www.cygwin.com"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; installed, but I wasn't sure that I would trust that to give me a bootable backup.  So, my strategy for now is to use &lt;a href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/"&gt;Acronis True Image&lt;/a&gt; to make a backup copy of my drive, and then use &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/prophoto/synctoy.mspx"&gt;Microsoft's SyncToy&lt;/a&gt; to periodically copy new files from the laptop to the backup drive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One benefit of this strategy is that it has been easy to upgrade my hard drives.  My MacBook only had a 60-GB drive, which got full pretty quick; now it has a 160-GB drive with plenty of extra space.  I also grew my Windows laptop drive from 120 GB to 160 GB.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'll play around with the "Time Machine" feature of Leopard, but I'll probably keep relying on the simpler backup strategy instead of Apple's slick magic stuff.

I've worn contact lenses since I was a teenager.  I've never liked eyeglasses: they're too heavy, too fragile, too dusty, and just plain uncomfortable.

&lt;p&gt;
I've worn contact lenses since I was a teenager.  I've never liked eyeglasses: they're too heavy, too fragile, too dusty, and just plain uncomfortable.  In contrast, contacts are lightweight, they rarely get dirty, they provide peripheral vision, and you don't have to wear ugly clip-on sunglasses over them.  I've never understood why anyone would prefer glasses, other than because their eyes simply can't handle them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, a persuasive woman suggested she'd like to see me in glasses more often, so I decided to give glasses another try.  My fifteen-year-old pair had very large lenses, which are great for visibility but they are heavy and unfashionable.  I wore them only in those rare times when my eyes were irritated by allergies or other problems.  I decided to try some new frames, and after some searching, settled on this Ray-Ban #6127 Bronze frame.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I figure I'll wear them for the rest of the week to see if I can get used to them.  I expect to be back in my contacts next week, except for time spent with the persuasive woman.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
UPDATE: I hate wearing them, but the persuasive woman likes them, so, well...

Last week, I had my first complete physical exam in twenty years.  I figured that, because I'm 40, I ought to get one.  I was wondering what problems they might find.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
EKG, heart sounds, lungs, reflexes, and everything were fine.  However, my blood pressure was high.  It was also high when I had my aviation exam, and both my parents have high blood pressure, so I finally had to accept the fact that I have a problem that probably can't be solved with rest, exercise, and a good diet.  The doctor prescribed a daily dosage of blood pressure control medication.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Medication&lt;/i&gt;.  In one sense, it's no big deal; lots of people are on medication.  But, for the first time, I've been prescribed a daily dosage that I'll probably have to take for the rest of my life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Does this make me officially middle-aged?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
UPDATE:  This means that if I want to fly again, I'll have to get cleared by the FAA medical staff again, which is a 4-to-6-week procedure.  My medication is one that is approved by the FAA, but they review such things on a case-by-case basis.

My Mom likes MSN.com.  It's been her homepage for years, and I've accepted the fact that I won't be able to get her to switch to a better portal.  However, every time Mom gets a new computer, she somehow gets tricked into signing up for MSN dial-up service for $9.99/month, despite the fact that she already has a broadband Internet connection.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mom's a smart woman, so I'm not sure why this keeps happening.  I think the new computers' desktops are always cluttered with crapware icons, and as she clicks them all to see what they do, one of them offers to help her "get connected to the Internet," even though she's already connected to the Internet.  Then an animated translucent butterfly pesters her until the clicks "OK."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm sure there are people who actually would find it helpful for a new Windows machine to assist them in setting up a dial-up account.  But, it would be even more helpful if the MSN take-your-money wizard would detect whether a dial-up connection is really needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next time I help set up a new computer, I'll be sure to delete anything that says "MSN" before turning it over to the owner.

I got a comment from "dt" suggesting that what I really wanted to use was the standard Python &lt;tt&gt;SocketServer&lt;/tt&gt; module.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today, I had to write a "real server" in Python, so I finally got around to looking into &lt;tt&gt;SocketServer&lt;/tt&gt;.  The documentation wasn't helpful, but the source code for the module was straightforward, so I figured things out pretty quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After work, I decided to create a more generic version of what I'd done while I was on the clock.  What follows is my new "starting point" for implementing a server process in Python.  It's about 300 lines long, which is a bit large for a "Hello, world!" kind of program, but it has these nifty new features:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server starts a daemon process, disconnected from the user's terminal, like it should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server writes to a log file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It implements a simple protocol between client and server.  Basically, the client just sends its command-line arguments to the server, and the server processes the command and sends output back, which the client writes to standard output.  (This protocol should, of course, be replaced with whatever protocol your real server has to handle; the template is just in place for testing and demonstration.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can work with TCP/IP sockets, or can use UNIX domain sockets (on platforms that support them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've only tried it on Mac OS X and Linux.  It will need some work for Windows, but thankfully, I haven't had to do much Windows programming lately, so I'm not going to worry about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Making the necessary changes to use a base of &lt;tt&gt;ForkingTCPServer&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ThreadingTCPServer&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ThreadingUnixStreamServer&lt;/tt&gt;, or other variations is left as an exercise for the reader.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I welcome any suggestions for improvement.
&lt;/p&gt;

for your purposes.

The template contains a few UNIXisms.  Modification may be needed for

I have my own domain that I've been using for e-mail for the past few years.  Most of my e-mail goes there, and then gets forwarded to a Yahoo! mail account, which in turn gets downloaded to my Macbook.  This gives me a couple of nice features:  I can read everything in the nice Mac Mail app when I'm at home, but I can also access everything via the web when I'm elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another nice feature was that I had the mail server configured such that &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;@mydomain.com would get to me.  This made it easy to essentially create new e-mail accounts whenever I needed a new one.  For example, if Microsoft wants me to register for something, I'd give them "microsoft@mydomain.com" as my e-mail address.  Since every website in the world wants my e-mail address, I figured that doing this would give me a way to create a different e-mail address for everybody who needs to contact me, making it easy to filter out stuff that I didn't want.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This worked great, until today.  Today, my hosting provider, A2 Hosting, decided to disable the feature that automatically forwards everything to one place.  Now, I need to create accounts or forwarders for every single address that I'd like to handle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that I've been doing this for a long time, and I don't have a list of all the addresses I've used.  Every business and every website I've interacted with in the past couple of years will no longer be able to contact me, unless I can remember them.  So, now I'm not going to be getting a lot of e-mails that are important to me.  I'm screwed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The provider disabled this feature due to spam.  It is too easy for spammers to just randomly generate e-mail addresses for every domain, and there is a cost to the provider for every e-mail they forward.  I do sympathize, but it doesn't change the fact that I am now screwed by their policy change.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I think I need to find another hosting provider, so I can start getting e-mail again.  Anybody out there happy with theirs?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alternatively, I suppose I could write a script to find all the e-mail addresses for which I've received mail for the past couple of years.  Switching providers sounds a lot simpler.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;John from Cincinnati&lt;/em&gt; is weird, but has the best opening credits of any series ever.  I'll watch anything that has Rebecca DeMornay in it, but this one seems special.  I don't know what's going on, but I trust that David Milch (the genius behind &lt;em&gt;Deadwood&lt;/em&gt;) will eventually deliver.  I am determined to learn how to surf before I get too old.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Flight of the Conchords&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly funny.  I like how the "music videos" spontaneously arise during each episode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please watch them.  If you don't like them, then you and I have radically different worldviews.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Update (2009/6/10): Well, I was right about John from Cincinnati: cancelled after one season. Flight of the Conchords lasted two seasons.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I took it in to the local Apple Genius Bar, and they took it in for repair.  I should have it back in a week or less.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm glad I have a Genius Bar nearby, considering all the problems I've been having with recent Apple products.  I've been using computers for almost thirty years, but have never needed repairs or service until I bought the iMac G5 and the Macbook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;UPDATE 2007/07/19:&lt;/em&gt; Got the Macbook back, and it's working fine now.  According to the service form, the following parts were replaced:

The developers of &lt;a href="http://www.scons.org"&gt;SCons&lt;/a&gt; don't seem to be very interested in this, but I've found a way to dramatically speed up SCons builds for MSVC8 (Visual Studio 2005's C++ compiler).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pp&gt;
We've got a fairly big codebase with a few levels.  It was taking over a minute to read all the SConstruct/SConscript files, even when there was nothing to do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I ran the profiler, and found that the bulk of the time was in minidom.py and expatbuilder.py.  This was surprising, because I didn't think SCons used XML.
&lt;p&gt;
Searching further, it turns out that for MSVC8, to determine library and include paths SCons opens a registry key which contains XML, and parses it.  For our codebase, it was doing this about 300 times per build.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I hacked up my personal copy of SCons/Tool/msvc.py, and now instead of over a minute, it only takes 20 seconds.  I don't consider this a "patch", because I don't really know much about SCons internals, and so this could be totally wrong, but maybe someone can figure out the right way to do what I have done and get it into CVS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is to cache the results of _get_msvc8_path, so that the XML parsing doesn't happen every time.  I added a global variable to msvc.py, containing an empty dictionary:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;START NEW CODE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;KDJ: cache results of _get_msvc8_path in a dictionary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cached_msvc8_path = {}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;END NEW CODE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, I changed a few lines in get_msvc_path as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    if version_num &amp;gt;= 8.0:
        # ORIGINAL: return _get_msvc8_path(path, str(version_num), platform, suite)
        # START NEW CODE
        global cached_msvc8_path
        if not cached_msvc8_path.has_key(path):
            cached_msvc8_path[path] = _get_msvc8_path(path, str(version_num), platform, suite)
        return cached_msvc8_path[path]
        # END NEW CODE
    elif version_num &amp;gt;= 7.0:
        return _get_msvc7_path(path, str(version_num), platform)

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My goal was to run the full course, without slowing to a walk.  This goal turned out to be unrealistic.  I ran the first three miles without a problem, but then I reached "Cardiac Hill," a long uphill stretch so-named for the obvious reason, and also because there is a hospital conveniently located next to it.  About halfway up the hill, I started feeling dizzy, and I decided it was better to abandon the goal than to collapse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After clearing the top of the hill, I set a new goal: run the remainder of the course.  That didn't work either; after a half mile or so I again started feeling queasy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I set yet another goal:  walk to the five-mile marker, and then run the last 1.2-mile stretch to the finish.  I accomplished that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I didn't really run a 10K today.  I ran a 5K and a 2K, with a 3K walk in between.  My time from start to finish was 69 minutes, 28 seconds.  I expect to do better next year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not disappointed in my performance.  This was my first time.  I don't have any steep hills in the area where I usually run, so I wasn't prepared for Cardiac Hill.  The course is tricky, because the first half is mostly downhill, giving you a false sense of optimism, and then the second half is mostly uphill.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After finishing at Piedmont Park, it is a half-hour walk to get back to the MARTA train station.  That's something they don't point out in the informational handouts.  I would have rested for a while in the park before starting the walk if I'd known.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So anyway, now I have the "coveted Peachtree Road Race t-shirt."  It makes it all worthwhile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was impressed with how well organized the event was.  Getting 55,000 into the starting area, lining them up, giving them water and t-shirts, and getting them back home seems to me like a major undertaking, but I never felt crowded, delayed, or unsure of where I was supposed to go and what I was supposed to do.  MARTA, the city police, the Atlanta Track Club, and other involved parties seem to really have their @#$% together for this event.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I didn't take my camera with me.  There was one shot I really wanted to take: a wide-angle shot of hundreds of runners lined up at the banks of porta-potties, taken from above the parking lot.  Maybe next year . . . .

One thing that makes me laugh about eHarmony.com and Match.com is the terrible pictures that women post of themselves.  Most of the pictures are of women at company Christmas parties, wedding receptions, or at other kinds of celebrations, which means that the pictures usually have the following features:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alcoholic beverage in hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drunken expression on the face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bright flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;red-eye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uncomfortable clothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cropped-out boyfriend/ex-husband&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another popular type of picture is the vacation photo.  The kind where there is some great, big, important, old building filling the frame, but if you look really closely, you can just barely make out a tiny woman standing in front of it, wearing sunglasses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
C'mon ladies, this is simple marketing.  If you really want the Right Guys to notice you, get a couple of good pictures of yourself.  I don't mean Glamour-Shots-style pictures; you should just have some pictures that show your face in flattering light with a pleasant smile, without any distracting features.  The smart women also have a full-length picture or two, because, well, men like to see that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Don't worry if you don't look like a supermodel.  Nice guys aren't looking for that; they just want to know a woman isn't hideous before starting a conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I volunteer to take pictures of any beautiful women who need me to do so.  I won't charge you anything, but you will have to have coffee with me.  It's part of my creative process.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By the way, I haven't seen any of the men's pictures on the dating sites, so I don't know their common foibles.  Maybe my female readers can let me know what men usually do wrong, so I can check my own pictures.

&lt;p&gt;
It's a lot of fun looking through those books now.  I remember holding the paper versions in my hands, and typing the programs into my Atari 800. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My favorite among the books is &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/"&gt;De Re Atari: A Guide to Effective Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by Chris Crawford, Lane Winner, Jim Cox, Amy Chen, Jim Dunion, Kathleen Pitta, Bob Fraser, and Gus Makrea.  I spent a lot of time studying this book, learning all the ways to do cool stuff with the Atari 8-bit hardware.  It also contains a lot of advice about how to design software, and most of that advice is still applicable today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Those were the good old days, when developing software for personal computers required knowledge of hardware registers, assembly language, memory layouts, and so on.  Today, we hide the details of the hardware as much as possible, but I think having experience with such low-level stuff is beneficial.  If you're a young whippersnapper who has only used high-level APIs like DirectX, OpenGL, and Windows GDI to do graphics, I'd recommend paging though some of these old books to see how programmers used to do things. &lt;/p&gt;

Because my birthday is in January, I do Birthday Resolutions instead of New Year's Resolutions. After all, that gives me a couple more weeks to figure out what it is I want to do with the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got one year to do all the things I want to do before I turn 40. But there's nothing I want to do. Yeah, I'd like to get into better shape, be smarter with my money, clean out my closets, find a better job, and the other typical stuff, but I know that none of these wants are engaging enough to hold my attention for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I really don't have anything to write about, but I wanted to record this so that I can look at it next year and be comforted that I didn't fail to accomplish any of my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

Archived Remoting.Corba documentation is still available via &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/remoting-corba"&gt;The Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net"&gt;Remoting.Corba&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source .NET library that provides interoperability between the .NET Framework and CORBA servers/clients, using the .NET Remoting architecture.
&lt;p&gt;
I started this project to learn more about .NET Remoting and to apply my knowledge of CORBA. My basic goal was to be able to write .NET programs that interacted with CORBA-based applications using typical .NET Remoting code.  For example, if a CORBA server supported this IDL:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// CORBA IDL
interface Adder {
    long add_longs(in long arg1, in long arg2);
    double add_doubles(in double arg1, in double arg2);
};&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
then one could write a C# program that invoked the server, without need for an ORB, using code something like this:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// standard .NET Remoting stuff
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels;
using System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging;

// Remoting.Corba
using Remoting.Corba.Channels.Iiop;

namespace MyExample
{
    // define .NET interface mapping for IDL interface
    interface Adder {
        int add_longs(int arg1, int arg2);
        double add_doubles(double arg1, double arg2);
    };

    class App {
        // entry point
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                // register IIOP channel with Remoting
                ChannelServices.RegisterChannel(new IiopClientChannel());

                // Use a standard CORBA stringified object reference for the server
                string ior = "corbaloc:iiop:localhost:9999/Adder";

                // create the proxy to the server object
                Adder server = (Adder) Activator.GetObject(typeof(Adder), ior);

                // execute some methods on the remote object
                Console.Out.WriteLine("1 + 2 = {0}", server.add_longs(1, 2));
                Console.Out.WriteLine("1.0 + 2.0 = {0}", server.add_doubles(1.0, 2.0));
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.Error.WriteLine("Exception: " + ex.ToString());
            }
        }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The IiopClientChannel class from the R.C library takes care of generating and interpreting the CORBA IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) messages and pumping them through the .NET runtime. There is also an IiopServerChannel class that can be used to implement CORBA servers using .NET Remoting.
&lt;p&gt;
It was pretty cool when it worked.  The .NET Framework's Remoting architecture is very open, allowing programmers to plug in their own network protocols and messaging formats.  I used some custom attributes to provide information needed by the CORBA engine that could not be gleaned via data types and reflection mechanisms.
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, while the .NET Remoting architecture is open, it is not well documented.  If all you want to do is send a SOAP message via some protocol other than HTTP (for example, via UDP, via message queues, via e-mail, etc.), then it is pretty easy to plug your own stuff in.  But if you are doing anything more complicated, then you will quickly discover that the only way to figure out what's going on inside .NET is to look at the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3A1C93FA-7462-47D0-8E56-8DD34C6292F0&amp;displaylang=en"&gt;Rotor&lt;/a&gt; source code.
&lt;p&gt;
The project was valuable to me in that I learned a lot about .NET and C#. It was also gratifying to see other people using it and expressing interest in it. I was especially excited when it was mentioned in Don Box's Spoutlet, and when Miguel Icaza started playing around with it in Mono. It even got a few pages devoted to it in a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619220/qid=1069133497/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-4292430-8931121?v=glance&amp;s=books"&gt;Microsoft Press book&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote this code during a period when I was not working any paying jobs, so I was always hoping I would find somebody willing to pay me to add features.  There were a few nibbles, but users were generally able to add features themselves instead of hiring me to do so.  I talked to some people at Microsoft and Inprise about potential deals, but nothing came of it.
&lt;p&gt;
I have put a few projects on SourceForge, but this was the first one where I got any significant contributions from other developers. Michael Sawczyn created an IDL compiler.  Other developers did some bug fixing, refactoring, and feature additions.  It never reached the "critical mass" needed to keep it going after I lost interest, but I think it was close.
&lt;p&gt;
I worked on R.C for a few months. I lost interest in it due to several factors:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No paying customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No real need to use it myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the low-hanging fruit was gone; further development would have involved a lot of very technical work with little tangible benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The appearance of commercial CORBA ORBs for .NET from Borland and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limitations of the .NET framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We hit limitations of the .NET framework when trying to figure out how to map remote object references back to objects in the same process. The only way to do it was to use reflection to invoke private methods of internal .NET classes.  That prospect triggered enough of an "Ewww!" response that I decided further work was only going to make me feel worse.
&lt;p&gt;
I used a &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041213054715/kristopherjohnson.net/cgi-bin/rc/wiki.pl?Remoting.Corba_Wiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; to distribute the "documentation" for the project.  I liked how the wiki turned out, but there were few contributions to it from anyone except myself.
&lt;p&gt;
So what did I get out of Remoting.Corba? Obviously, I learned about .NET Remoting and some more about the internals of CORBA. I got practice writing C# networking code. I made some contacts in the industry. I wish I could have used R.C on a real project, but that might have taken the fun out of it.</content><category term=".NET"></category><category term="CORBA"></category></entry></feed>
